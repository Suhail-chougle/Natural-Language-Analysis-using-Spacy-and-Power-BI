Project Title: NLP Analysis of Journal Articles and Interactive Power BI Dashboard

This project focuses on utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze a corpus of journal articles from various sources. By extracting insightful information from the text data, I have created an interactive Power BI dashboard that showcases key findings and insights derived from the analysis.

Project Overview:
The project involves extracting texts from five different text files, comprising a diverse set of journal articles. The corpus contains essential information about the articles, including article name, date, domain, authors, and most importantly, abstracts. The abstracts serve as the foundation for the majority of the analysis.

Technologies Used:
- Python for the NLP analysis and data manipulation.
- Spacy and NLTK libraries for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and more.
- Power BI for designing and creating an interactive dashboard to present insights visually.

Data Extraction and Preprocessing:
I describe the process of extracting texts from the five text files and outline the steps taken to preprocess the data. The preprocessing phase involves text cleaning and preparation to ensure accurate and meaningful results from the NLP analysis. I also address any challenges encountered during this phase and the strategies used to overcome them.

NLP Analysis:
I explain the NLP techniques applied using Spacy and NLTK libraries. These techniques include feature extraction from the abstracts, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the journal articles. I delve into the specific parameters used in the analysis and how they contribute to gaining valuable insights from the data.

Power BI Dashboard:
The Power BI dashboard serves as a one-point information center for presenting the key findings and insights from the NLP analysis. I provide a detailed overview of the dashboard's design and layout, describing the various visualizations used to represent the data effectively. The interactive nature of the dashboard allows users to explore and understand the results effortlessly.

Feel free to explore the code, visualizations, and insights provided in this repository. I am continuously updating the project as I make improvements, and your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated. Together, let's uncover valuable knowledge from the world of journal articles through the power of natural language processing and data visualization!

There are a total of five text files for analysis and one "untitled" which contains the code
