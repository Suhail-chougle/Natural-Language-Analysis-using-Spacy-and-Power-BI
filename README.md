Project Title: NLP Analysis of Journal Articles and Interactive Power BI Dashboard

This project focuses on utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze a corpus of journal articles from various sources. By extracting insightful information from the text data, I have created an interactive Power BI dashboard that showcases key findings and insights derived from the analysis.

Project Overview:
The project involves extracting texts from five different text files, comprising a diverse set of journal articles. The corpus contains essential information about the articles, including article name, date, domain, authors, and most importantly, abstracts. The abstracts serve as the foundation for the majority of the analysis.

Technologies Used:
- Python for the NLP analysis and data manipulation.
- Spacy and NLTK libraries for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and more.
- Power BI for designing and creating an interactive dashboard to present insights visually.

Feel free to explore the code, visualizations, and insights provided in this repository. 
There are a total of five text files for analysis and one "untitled" which contains the code
