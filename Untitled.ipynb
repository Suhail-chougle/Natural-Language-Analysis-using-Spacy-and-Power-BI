      "Macrolepiota albuminosa (Berk.) Pegler is abundant in active polysaccharides, but little is known about their structures and solution properties. In this study, water-extracted polysaccharides from M. albuminosa (MAWP) were purified into three fractions with structural heterogeneity, which was attributed to the diversity in molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and linkage patterns, further affecting their solution properties. Methylation and NMR analysis revealed MAWP-60p and MAWP-70 were a 3-O-methylated glucomannogalactan and a previously unreported glucomannogalactan, whereas MAWP-80 was elucidated as a branched galactoglucan. Besides, three fractions exhibited random coil conformation in aqueous solution, while MAWP-60p had the highest viscosity due to its highest molecular weight, mean square radius of gyration (Rg) and O-methyl group attached to the backbone. The molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and glycosidic linkages might be the major contributors to the flexibility, molecular size and stereochemistry of mushroom polysaccharide chains.

      "A homogeneous galactoglucan was purified from the alkali-extracted polysaccharides from the basidioma of Macrolepiota albuminosa by gradient ethanol precipitation, whose proposed structure was given for the first time. Results. Showed it had a molecular weight of 210 kDa, and mainly consisted of glucose and galactose. There were abundant filaments, randomly distributed sheet-like and flaky appearance in its surface by SEM observation. Its backbone comprised beta-(1 6)-Glc p, alpha-(1 6)-Gal p and beta-(1 3,6)-Glc p residues at 4:1:1, terminated by beta-(1 3)-Glc p and T-Glc p residues. Rheological measurements suggested its steady flow behavior was highly dependent on concentrations. Newtonian behavior was evident at low concentrations, whereas pseudoplastic behavior was observed at high concentrations. Besides, the X-ray diffraction patterns proved the presence of amorphous structure. The conformational parameters were detected by HPSEC-MALLS-RI, revealing a random coil conformation in NaNO3 aqueous solution. This work provides a theoretical basis for the application of polysaccharides from M. albuminosa in food-and drug-based therapies. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "A homogeneous beta-glucan (JHMP-70) was obtained from Hypsizygus marmoreus by alkali extraction and ethanol precipitation, and had an apparent molecular weight of 394 kDa. Its fine structure was investigated by FT-IR, methylation combined with GC-MS and 1D and 2D NMR analysis. Results indicated JHMP-70 was a branched beta-(1 6)-glucan substituted at O-3 by the non-reducing beta-Glcp and/or beta-(1 3)-linked beta-Glcp side chains at a ratio of 1:1. SEM observation revealed that there were micro-spherical shapes intertwined with randomly distributed fibrous filaments. Rheological measurements showed that its flow behavior was highly dependent on the concentration. Newtonian behavior was evident at low concentration, whereas pseudoplastic behavior was observed at high concentration. Besides, the addition of salt ions (Na + or Ca2+) significantly decreased the apparent viscosity of JHMP-70 solution. The low viscosity of JHMP-70 was probably attributed to its structural features, including main chain structure, branching degree and side chain length. This work can provide a basis theory to expand the application of the polysaccharides from H. marmoreus in food industry, because their lower viscosity and superior fluidity are desired in beverage products to impart stability against phase separation without compromising other sensorial properties.

      "A novel enzyme-catalyzed method was developed for the synthesis of phytosterol polyol esters from beta-sitosterol and polyols (sorbitol, mannitol and xylitol) by two-step transesterification using divinyl adipate (DVA) as a link. A high conversion (exceeding 94%) of beta-sitosterol with a vinyl group was achieved, in the presence of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL), at low temperature (35 Â°C) within 30 min. Subsequently, the maximum conversion of phytosterol polyol esters (>94%) was obtained using alkaline protease from Bacillus subtilis at 65 Â°C. Phytosterol polyol esters had enhanced thermal stability (up to an above 355 Â°C) and excellent water solubility (4.6-7.9 mM at 35 Â°C). Moreover, obvious increases in the bioaccessibility (41.5-63.6%) and intestinal uptake (5.2-6.5%) were observed using a simulated gastrointestinal digestion/Caco-2 cell model. These results highlighted the key role of hydrophilic structural modifications on physicochemical properties and absorption of phytosterols. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "The existence of microwave non-thermal effects in food processing is still debated. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the conformation, electrostatic profiles, and intramolecular hydrogen bonds (intra-HB) of glucose in aqueous solution under alternating electric fields of microwaves ranging from 0 to 109 V/m at 2.45 GHz. The results showed a field-induced threshold of 109 V/m. At the threshold, alternating microwaves reoriented the flexible moieties and thus enhanced the intra-HB. The conformational transition among gg, gt, and tg conformers at 109 V/m possibly resulted from the uneven electrostatic potential and the increased intra-HB. In practice, the maximum electric field of microwaves is several times weaker than the threshold, verifying the absence of microwave non-thermal effects for glucose molecules in food processing. This study provides a novel strategy to evaluate the potential non-thermal effects of microwaves in food processing and the related underlying food safety issues. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "Frozen cooked noodles (FCNs) were prepared with different levels (0,1%, 3% and 5%) of gluten addition, and the effect of gluten on quality of FCNs was investigated. Cooking properties analysis showed that water absorption ratio and cooking loss of FCNs decreased at first and then increased with the increase of gluten addition. Compared to FCNs with 1% and 5% gluten additions, recooked FCNs with 3% gluten addition had a similar texture property to control sample, and they had the highest tensile force and distance, and the lowest surface tackiness. Meanwhile, the recooked FCNs (3% gluten addition) had smaller pores, denser and more complex gluten network, and their force and elasticity during chewing were the best in sensory evaluation. Low-field 1H nuclear magnetic resonance showed that the lowest T21 (0.11ms) and T23 (51.11ms) were found in the recooked FCNs (3% gluten addition). Furthermore, the alpha-helix of samples increased while the beta-sheet and random coil decreased, the glutenin macropolymer content of recooked FCNs increased at first and then decreased with adding gluten. These results indicated that the recooked FCNs (3% gluten addition) had a lower surface tackiness, higher sensory scores, and better quality. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",

      "A novel dispersive micro-solid-phase extraction (DMSPE) method is established for the determination of seven acaricides (clofentezine, benzomate, fenpyroximate, diafenthiuron, pyridaben, doramectin, and ivermectin) in fruit juice and functional food by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. In this method, these analytes were extracted from apple juice and Curcuma wenyujin using cucurbituril used as the adsorbent, water as the extraction solvent, and methanol as the elution solvent. The primary parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were optimized by experiments for concentration of adsorbent, oscillation time, desorption solvent, and pH value and by response surface methodology. Under the optimal conditions, all target analytes had a good linear relationship, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.9900 to 0.9940, the limits of detection were 0.42-5.16 ng/mL, the limits of quantification were 1.39-17.18 ng/mL, and the spiked recoveries of seven target compounds in real samples ranged from 70.04 to 94.95%. The intra-day precision RSD variations ranged from 0.13 to 0.70%, and the inter-day precision RSDs were between 0.38 and 1.4%, which had good reproducibility and repeatability. In general, DMSPE is a convenient, efficient, and environmentally friendly method for sample preparation, which has the potential for microextraction.

      "In this study, we investigated the influence of various factors on the formation of 2-monochloro-1,3-propanediol and 3-monochloro-1,2-propanediol (MCPD) esters in Chinese fried dough sticks. The results showed types of oil significantly affected the content of MCPD esters in fried dough sticks, with palm oil responsible for the highest. As well, temperature and time affected the content of MCPD esters (P< 0.05). Treatment at 200 Â°C for 4 min resulted in 1.87 mg/kg 3-MCPD esters and 0.68 mg/kg 2-MCPD esters, respectively. The dough containing 1 g/100 g NaCl was fried at 180 Â°C for 4 min, resulting in elevated levels of MCPD esters. MCPD esters in fried dough sticks constantly varied during the 8-h cycle in 3 consecutive days and the 12-h frying cycle. Pearson correlation test showed 3-MCPD esters had a positive correlation with 2-MCPD esters (R = 0.920), which allowed 3-MCPD esters to be a representative index of MCPD esters. A good correlation between the acid value (AV), p-anisidine value (p-AnV), color (DeltaEpsilon) of frying oil and MCPD esters in fried dough sticks was also found. The changes of MCPD esters of fried dough sticks were assumed to be caused by oxidation and hydrolysis of oil during frying. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "We used a risk-benefit model to evaluate the effects of different farming methods and consumption habits on dietary risk of Chinese mitten crab. In this study, we found that cadmium levels in the total edible parts and brown meat were 0.029-0.462 mg/kg and 0.017-1.694 mg/kg, respectively. Cadmium exposure experiment showed that brown meat was the main enrichment site of cadmium. Fatty acid test found that the EPA+ DHA content in total edible parts fed with formulated feed and iced trash fish was 19.64 3.62 mg/g and 28.72 2.30 mg/g (p> 0.05), respectively, and that in brown meat was 27.66 5.16 mg/g and 40.15 3.50 mg/g (p> 0.05), respectively. According to the risk-benefit model analysis, the dietary risk of brown meat under the two breeding methods is relatively high, but the risk quotient is less than 1. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "Sous-vide cooking is a highly praised method used to cook muscle foods because of its desired effect of providing better sensory properties by maintaining texture. In this study, we further explored the effect of water on texture by revealing the mechanisms of moisture migration. Low field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) showed that the nonflowing water in sous-vide cooking hairtail was 2.36 0.33% higher than that in traditional cooking. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to clarify the law of moisture migration induced by temperature, and the moisture migration of the sous-vide cooking hairtail was slower during the holding heating stage. The microstructure explained the change rules of the texture. The degree of change was consistent with the moisture migration level. Digitalizing analysis quantitatively verified the effect of sous-vide cooking on the hairtail microstructure. The low moisture migration rate of sous-vide cooking resulted in a less damaged microstructure of the hairtail, manifesting as a desirable texture. Practical Application. LF-NMR and MRI showed that sous-vide hairtails exhibited a lower moisture migration rate. The holding heating stage only slightly changed the microstructure of the hairtail. The digitalizing analysis confirmed the moisture migration mechanisms. Heat-induced protein denaturation was closely related to the water state. Â© 2022 Institute of Food Technologists\n",
      "Relationship between heat/mass transfer and color change during the drying process of Radix Paeoniae Alba (RPA) slice was studied. The results show that drying temperature and moisture content are the main factors affecting the color of the sample. The lightness value (L) decreases as the moisture content decreases, while the red-green value (a) and yellow-blue value (b) increase with the decrease in moisture content. The higher the temperature, the lower the L, while the higher a and b, and the greater the total color difference (DeltaE). The total color difference values at 60Â°C, 80Â°C and 100Â°C were 5.58, 6.99 and 9.05, respectively. Based on the moisture change, a model coupling heat/mass transfer and color change was presented to illustrate the results during the drying process.

      "This study aims to prepare citrate-esterified Arenga pinnata (Wurmb.) Merr starch (APS) with different degrees of substitution (DS [0, 0.02, 0.24, 0.40]) and evaluate in vitro digestibility, pasting, and thermal properties of citrate APS. The citrate APS surface become rougher. Citric acid modification led to significant changes in molecular and crystal structure citric acid treatment significantly reduced molecular weight of APS, and the molecular weight was decreased with increasing the DS. The citrate APS possessed a lower pasting viscosity and a higher resistant starch (RS) content. RS content of APS citrate was increased with increasing the DS, and the maximum RS content reached 74.21%. Citric acid modification improved thermal stability of the APS. These results suggested that the structural alterations might be responsible for changes of APS citrate properties and the citrate APS was an excellent potential food additive that had desirable functional properties and high RS content. Novelty impact statement. The non-conventional APS was modified using citric acid. The citrate APS possessed a lower pasting viscosity and had a higher RS content, up to 74.21%.

      "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is effective in reducing the fishy malodor of sea products. However, the biotransformation pathways are still unclear. The seaweed B. Fusco-purpurea was taken as an example to investigate the chemical transformation pathways for the deodorization process with S. cerevisiae fermentation. Sensory evaluation, GC-MS, GC-MS-O and odor activity value (OAV) analyses showed the fishy odorants were 1-octen-3-ol, (E)-2-nonenal, 2,4-decadienal, 2-pentylfuran, 2-octen-1-ol and nonanal. The removal of fishy malodor was related to the reactions of reduction, dehydrogenation, deformylation-oxygenation and ester syntheses via catalysis of aldehyde dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenases, epoxide hydrolase, aldehyde deformylating-oxygenase, enone reductase, oxidases, dehydrogenases, aldo-keto reductases, ester synthase and acyltransferase. Interestingly, for the first time, it was found that 3,5-octadien-2-one transformed to 6-octen-2-one; and 2-pentylfuran transformed to o-cymene and hexyl acetate. Our findings enrich the knowledge for the removal of fishy malodor from sea products such as seaweeds. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "In this study, the ameliorative effect of water bamboo shoot (WBS) on acute alcoholism mice was investigated and potential biological compounds were explored. Results showed that extraction methods significantly affected the active substances contents and bioactivities of WBS. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that alkali extract (NE) obtained the highest score, therefore, it was selected for further analysis. Animal experiments showed that NE demonstrated ameliorative effects on acute alcoholism mice as evident by significantly elevated activities of dehydrogenase (alcohol dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase) and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase), whereas significantly reduced the levels of aminotransferase (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase) in serum. The potential bioactive activity compounds of NE were explored by UPLC-MS/MS and bioinformatics analysis. Butyl isobutyl phthalate vanillin, ferulic acid methyl ester might be the major compounds in NE on alleviating acute alcoholism. These results indicated that WBS possesses potential ameliorating effect on acute alcoholism. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "An inclusion system of embedding ferulic acid into beta-cyclodextrin (FACD) with different host-guest stoichiometries was prepared by a co-precipitation method. Then, the physicochemical properties and release kinetics of the FACD were evaluated. The results of thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) proved the successful embedding of FA into the beta-cyclodextrin matrix. Four mathematical models were applied to adjust the ferulic acid release profile and identify preferential kinetics. The results of physicochemical properties confirmed the successful formation of the complexes. The loading capacity (LC) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of the inclusion complex (1:0.5) were 41.03.28 mg g-1 and 52.12.31%, respectively, which were significantly higher than other molar ratios. The release behaviour revealed that loaded FA molecules under various host-guest stoichiometries obey different release models. While lower host-guest stoichiometry (1:0.5) provided desirable EE, the moderate host-guest stoichiometry (1:1) exhibited faster release behaviour. The FACD inclusion complex could be a promising bioactive material for food preservation. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022\n",
      "Different approaches have been adopted to overcome the inherent shortcomings of native starches, and blending of different native starches has attracted much attention due to the \"clean-label\" feature and the low processing effort and cost. In the current study, we blended high-amylose maize starch (HA7) with wheat (WHE) or potato (POT) starch at 1:1 ratio (dry weight basis; dwb) and then comprehensively examined their thermal properties, pasting and gelling behaviors over the heating temperature range of 95-140Â°C, and in vitro digestibility in comparison with three individual starches. With an excess amount of water (starch: water = 1:3), gelatinization of individual starches generally appeared to be independent in the two starch blends. An exceptionally low percentage of retrogradation was observed for gelatinized HA7-WHE blend during cold storage, which could be partially ascribed to the formation of a large amount of amylose-lipid complexes (ALC). Greater resistance to thermal degradation and thixotropic breakdown during pasting at 120Â°C was found with HA7-WHE blend when compared with HA7-POT blend. Both starch blends could form gels with moderate strength (74.3-109.4g) after cooking at 120 and 140Â°C. The determined resistant starch (RS) and slowly digestible starch (SDS) contents of water-boiled HA7-WHE blend were higher than the calculated values when assuming simple additivity of the two starches. The interactions at both granular and molecular levels and the presence of ALC were responsible for the reported unique techno-functional attributes of HA7-WHE blend, which rendered it suitable for diverse food and industrial applications.

      "High oleic acid (OA) peanut seeds (PS) can be beneficial for human health. However, chemical variations in high-OA PS after domestic cooking are not fully understood. In order to investigate the impact of different cooking methods on the chemical profile of high-OA PS, widely established metabolomics approach was employed to identify the relative contents of PS metabolites. Herein, 630 metabolites within 27 categories were characterized in PS, of which 141, 157, 402 differential metabolites were observed in each treatment group (boiling, baking, and frying) when compared to the raw seed. Accordingly, bioactive substances were maximally preserved in baked high-OA PS. Further conventional methods (HPLC-UV/GC-MS) quantified the absolute composition of amino and fatty acids, verifying the reliability of metabolomic analysis. Collectively, the understanding of the phytochemical substances in relation to the domestic cooking method established a foundation for future high-OA PS processing. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "High oleic acid (OA) peanut seed (PS), contains a higher ratio of oleic acid (C18:1) compared to general PS, which is favored by consumers due to its health benefits. However, comprehensive lipid metabolite profiles of high-OA PS, once they have been processed via domestic cooking methods, have never been produced. To establish a scientific guide for the selection of the most appropriate processing method for high-OA PS, lipidomics was performed to identify 706 lipid metabolites in high-OA PS following boiling, baking and frying, between the three groups, 75, 175 and 242 lipid metabolites were differentially expressed respectively. Additionally, 46glycerolipids with C18:1molecular were observed in the lipid profiles of the treatment groups compared to the raw sample. Further evaluation of seven lipid peroxides and six antioxidant status of each testing group suggested that boiled PS retained the highest levels of lipids and antioxidant activity. Following these findings, boiling appears to be an appropriate processing method when attempting to conserve the beneficial substances found in the PS. Finally, the levels of major free fatty acids present in high-OA PS, were jointly quantified by conventional methods (GC-MS) and lipidomic analysis. FA/C16:0 levels were similar, FA/C18:0, FA/C18:1 displayed opposite results, FA/C18:2 levels increased following frying and FA/C18:3 levels were down regulated once the PS was boiled. This indicates that GC-MS is a potential method of validation for the results of lipidomic analysis. Conclusively, this in depth understanding of lipid content in relation to domestic cooking methods has provided a foundation for the processing of high-OA peanut products.

Twelve phenolic derivatives were identified in the free extract, including Nâ€²-caffeoyl-N-feruloylspermidine, Nâ€², N-dicaffeoylspermidine and N-(p-coumaroyl) serotonin reported for the first time in proso millets. Fifteen phenolic acid derivatives were found in the bound fraction with p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid being the major phenolic acids, as well as four ferulic acid dimers (DFAs) detected for the first time in proso millets. The total phenolic content (TPC) of the soluble and insoluble phenolic fractions varied from 592 to 1510 mg ferulic acid equivalents (FAE)/kg dry weight (DW) and 1146-2436 mg FAE/kg DW, respectively. The total flavonoid content (TFC) of the proso millets ranged from 284 to 978 mg rutin equivalents (RE)/kg DW. DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays were applied to determine in vitro antioxidant activities for all the phenolic extracts, and the antioxidant levels were attributed to TPCs.

      "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the major cause of global chronic hepatic injury, has obtained increasing attention while the current drug treatment still laid safety hazards. Major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs), the water-soluble proteins enriched in royal jelly (RJ), were applied to study its effects on improving NAFLD in the NAFLD mouse model. Herein, we demonstrated that intaking of 250-500mg/kg/day MRJPs significantly decreased the rate of obesity, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. Next, TOF to MRM (\"TM\") widely targeted metabolomics (untargeted metabolomics + widely targeted metabolomics) was further used to explore the potential mechanism, and we found that 500mg/kg MRJPs alleviated lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation mainly by regulating the metabolisms of alpha-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, by detecting multiple oxidative stress factors and inflammatory cytokines, we found that MRJPs indeed exerted antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Together, we demonstrated that MRJPs could mediate the progress of NAFLD through the \"multi-component-multi-target-multi-pathway\" mechanism, which could be considered as an ideal functional food in alleviating NAFLD. Practical applications. Royal jelly (RJ) is a bee product with high nutritional value. Major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) are water-soluble proteins in RJ. Our research showed that MRJPs significantly ameliorated NAFLD induced by a high-fat diet in mice, suggesting that MRJPs could be used as an active ingredient to help improve NAFLD, which was beneficial for the development of related functional foods and the economic value of RJ. Moreover, the metabolic pathways involved in the ameliorative effect of MRJPs were investigated, which provided new ideas for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Â© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC\n",
      "Gut microbiota-involved metabolism and intestinal absorption affecting bioaccessibility of triadimefon in strawberry and grape were investigated for the first time by coupling the in vitro digestion model with the Caco-2 cell model. Results showed that the gut microbiota decreased the bioaccessibility of triadimefon in strawberry by 31.00% but failed in grape, probably due to a negative modulation of the colon bacterial activity by dietary components in grapes. A strain of triadimefon-degrading bacteria, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, was isolated from the gut microbiota and its degradation products were profiled. This study also clarified a significant reduction in transepithelial transport (up to 32.81%) of triadimefon as a result of the barrier effect of gut microbiota. These findings provide new insights on the function of the gut microbiota in pesticide bioaccessibility and highlight the importance of including gut microbiota in pesticide residue risk assessments.

      "The homeostasis of circadian clock linked to bile acid (BA) metabolism and gut microbiota has profound benefits in maintaining the health status of the host. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevention and regulation of apple polyphenol extract (APE) on BA metabolism and gut microbiota by means of modulation of circadian rhythms in mice. Eighty male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into four groups: 24-hour ad libitum standard chow group (AC), ad libitum HFD group (AF), restricted 12 h daytime HFD feeding group (DF), and daytime HFD feeding with APE treatment group (DP). Five weeks later, the mice were sacrificed at 6 h intervals over a 24 h period. The results showed that APE decreased body weight and induced daily rhythms of Cry1 and Roralpha in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and Clock, Cry1 and Cry2 in the ileum in daytime HFD mice. APE significantly increased the expression of hepatic FXR at ZT0 and BSEP at ZT12 and inhibited the expression of ileac FXR at ZT12, reduced levels of fecal TBAs, secondary BAs, and unconjugated BAs at ZT0. Meanwhile, APE regulated the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota, and increased the abundance of probiotics. Therefore, our work revealed that APE as a clock-regulating natural compound could modulate BA metabolism and gut microbiota and protect against circadian disruption in a clock-dependent manner.

      "To investigate the potential role of apple polyphenol extract (APE) in the prevention and alleviation of circadian rhythm disturbances, eighty male C57BL/6mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were randomized into four groups: 24 h ad libitum feeding (AL), 12 h restricted nighttime feeding (NF) or daytime feeding (DF), and daytime feeding with APE intragastric administration (DF-APE). Five weeks later, the mice were sacrificed at 6 h intervals over 24 h. Disrupted fluctuations in serum lipid profiles and hormones, along with desynchronization of circadian clock genes and metabolic genes were observed after daytime HFD feeding. However, APE treatment improved hepatic steatosis and recovered circadian rhythms of Cry1/2, and genes Acc and Hsl related to lipid synthesis and hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters, and Cyp7a1 in bile acid synthesis.

      "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ameliorating effects of three yeast strains, Saccharomyces cerevisiae I4, Clavispora lusitaniae 30 and Pichia kudriavzevii 11, isolated from traditional fermented dairy food in Xinjiang, China, on the ulcerative colitis symptoms of Balb/c mice treated by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Among which, S. cerevisiae I4 had good tolerance to simulated gastrointestinal juice and strong adhesion to HT-29 cells monolayers. Furthermore, the three yeast strains were oral administered to Balb/c mice with DSS induced colitis. The weight loss, colon shortening and histological injury of colitis mice were ameliorated. Then, oral administration of S. cerevisiae I4 improved the immune state by reducing the contents of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta and increasing immunoglobulin. The relative expression of intestinal barrier proteins Claudin-1, Occludin and Zonula Occludins-1 (ZO-1) of the mice enhanced, and the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) content such as Propionic acid, Butyric acid, Isobutyric acid and Isovaleric acid in the feces of the mice increased to varying degrees, after S. cerevisiae I4 treatment compared with the model group of drinking 3% DSS water without yeast treatment. Moreover, S. cerevisiae I4 treatment lifted the proportion of beneficial bacteria such asMuribaculaceae, Lactobacillaceae and Rikenellaceae in the intestinal tract of the mice, the abundance of harmful bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Turicibacter was decreased. These results suggested that S. cerevisiae I4 could alleviate DSS induced colitis in mice by enhancing intestinal barrier function and regulating intestinal flora balance. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Among these compounds, 1h was found to possess the most potent tyrosinase inhibitory effect on both monophenolase and diphenolase activities, with IC50 values of 2.72muM and 15.86muM, respectively. The inhibitory effect of 1h on monophenolase activity was 4.6 times that of kojic acid. An inhibition kinetic assay indicated that 1h was a mixed-type and reversible inhibitor. The copper-binding and reducing ability assays, molecular docking study, intrinsic and ANS-binding fluorescence assays indicated that copper coordination and reduction is likely to be the causative mechanism for 1h-induced inhibition on tyrosinase. The results of color measurement and browning index determination indicated that treatment with 1h retarded effectively the browning of freshly-cut apples during their storage.

      "This study investigated the impact of meat processing surface bacteria (MPB) on biofilm formation by non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), and potential links between biofilm formation by STEC and biofilm-related genes in their genomes. Biofilm development by 50 MPB and 6 STEC strains in mono- and co-cultures was assessed by the crystal violet staining method, and their expression of curli and cellulose was determined using the Congo red agar method. Genes (n = 141) associated with biofilm formation in the STEC strains were profiled. Biofilm formation in general correlated with cellulose and curli expression in both mono- and co-cultures. Most MPB strains had antagonistic effects on the biofilm formation of the STEC strains. Of the genes investigated, 81% were common among the STEC strains and there seems to be a gene-redundancy in biofilm formation. The inability of the O26 strain to form biofilms could be due to mutations in the rpoS gene. Truncation in the mlrA gene in the O145 strain seems not affecting its biofilm formation alone or with MPB. The O45 strain, despite having the greatest number of biofilm-related genes, did not form measurable biofilms. Overall, biofilm formation of STEC was affected by curli-cellulose expression and companion strains. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a human foodborne pathogen, and it can form a mature biofilm on food and food contact surfaces to enhance their resistance to antibacterial agents. In this study, the effect of anti-biofilm enzymes (combined lipase, cellulase and proteinase K) on the inhibition and eradication of pathogen biofilm was evaluated. The biofilm content of V. parahaemolyticus showed the highest level at the incubation time of 24 h, and the combined enzymes significantly inhibited the biofilm's development. The biofilm's inhibition and eradication rate at an incubation time of 24 h was 89.7% and 66.9%, respectively. The confocal laser scanning microscopic images confirmed that the microcolonies' aggregation and the adhesion of biofilm were inhibited with the combined enzyme treatment. Furthermore, combined enzymes also decreased the concentration of exopolysaccharide (EPS) and disrupted the EPS matrix network, wherein the expression of the EPS-related gene, cpsA-J, was likewise suppressed. The combined enzymes showed an excellent inhibition effect of V. parahaemolyticus biofilm on different carriers, with the highest inhibition rate of 59.35% on nonrust steel plate. This study demonstrates that the combined enzyme of lipase, cellulase and proteinase K could be a novel candidate to overcome biofilm's problem of foodborne pathogens in the food industry.

      "Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive pathogen, that usually adheres to stainless steel (SS), and other abiotic surfaces in food processing that undergo repeated cleaning and cause the spread of Listeria. Through the enumeration of biofilm cells, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) component and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of biofilms, it was found that the ratio of cells and extracellular matrix is affected by nutrition status. Regardless of the temperature, all strains exhibited a higher adhesion ability when exposed to 10-fold diluted TSB-YE (DTSB-YE, nutrition deficiency). Three hour initial adhesion was significantly positively correlated with biofilm formation (p<0.01). DTSB-YE enhances initial attachment and subsequently promotes biofilm formation. The SEM analysis also showed that in DTSB-YE the adhesion and covered area of the attached cells were higher than those in TSB-YE (rich media). The amount of both extracellular polysaccharides and proteins was significantly higher when incubated in DTSB-YE than TSB-YE. The highest biofilm formation of Lm83 was observed in DTSBYE independent of temperature. The effects of nutrition deficiency on the expression of critical biofilm-associated genes of Lm 83 planktonic and biofilm cells were measured. The gene expression levels of inlA and sigB in biofilm cells in TSB-YE and DTSB-YE were approximately 95.7% and 88.0% and 42.2% and 45.7% lower than those in planktonic cells, respectively. However, the expression of inlA in DTSB-YE was significantly higher (p<0.05) than that in TSB-YE for the same cell state. Interestingly, the gene expression of motB was considerably higher in DTSB-YE than in TSBYE, regardless of the state. These results indicate that better cell motility in nutrient deficiencies might facilitate the cell aggression to promote biofilm formation. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",

However, the active constituents from P. notoginseng and their pharmacologic properties still need to be further explored. In this study, one new dammarane-type triterpenoid saponin (1), along with fourteen known analogs (2-15) were isolated and identified from the roots of P. notoginseng. The anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenetic and anti-dengue virus effects of these isolated compounds were further evaluated. Compounds 1, 3, 5-7 and 10-12 exerted anti-inflammatory effects in two different zebrafish inflammatory models. Among them, 11, with the most significant activities, alleviated the inflammatory response by blocking the MyD88/NF-kappaB and STAT3 pathways. Moreover, compound 15 showed anti-angiogenetic activities in Tg (fli1:EGFP) and Tg (flk1:GFP) zebrafish, while 3 and 5 only inhibited angiogenesis in Tg (fli1:EGFP) zebrafish. Additionally, compounds 1, 3, 6, 8, 9 and 12 suppressed the replication of Dengue virus either at the viral adsorption and entry stages or at the intracellular replication step. In conclusion, these findings enrich knowledge of the diversity of saponins in P. notoginseng and suggest that the dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins from P. notoginseng may be developed as potential functional foods to treat inflammation, angiogenesis or dengue-related diseases.

      "This work investigated the effects of inulin on the water migration, ice crystal formation, and freeze-thaw stability of surimi under different additive amounts and polymerization degrees (DP). All the three types of inulin were shown to restrict water fluidity in surimi in a DP and amount dependent manner, and 10% long-chain inulin (L-INU) had the most conspicuous restriction on water migration. Short-chain inulin (S-INU) and nature inulin (N-INU) not only showed a more prominent effect than L-INU on decreasing freezing temperature and preventing ice crystal growth under an amount-effect relationship, but also were detected to interact with proteins to facilitate their stabilization. Freeze-thaw stability tests demonstrated all the three types of inulin could significantly inhibit the deterioration of surimi quality. After several freeze-thaw cycles, 8% L-INU showed the most significant inhibitory effect on thawing water loss, superior to commercial cryoprotectant (CC) (sucrose plus sorbitol), while 8% S-INU and N-INU were comparable to CC and showed better performance than L-INU in terms of chrominance of surimi, breaking force and deformation, water holding capacity, texture properties and whiteness of surimi gel. Overall, 8% S-INU can better maintain the surimi gel properties and 8% L-INU can better restrain the thawing water loss. These results suggest the potential of inulin as a promising cryoprotectant candidate in the frozen surimi industry. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "Curcumin is a bioactive supplement known to have many medical benefits. However, it has low bioavailability due to its insolubility in aqueous solution and rapid degradation profile. In this paper, an oil-in-water (O/W) Pickering emulsion (PE) was fabricated ultrasonically with different cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) concentrations to investigate its effect on the physicochemical properties of PE and the storage stability of curcumin. The CNC-PE produced remained stable for at least one month. The highest encapsulation efficiency of curcumin in CNC-PE was found to exceed 99%. For storage of curcumin containing CNC-PE under dark conditions, good stability of curcumin was observed with a half-life of 98.47 d, reflecting a nearly 20-fold improvement as compared to other existing PE systems. On the other hand, storage under visible light, UV light, and at elevated temperature (50Â°C) increased the degradation rate of encapsulated curcumin following the order: 50Â°C > UV light > visible light > dark. Our findings elucidated the promising potential of CNC-PE as a food-safe delivery system for sensitive lipophilic bioactive compounds. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",

      "The emerging social media serves as a complementary source for consumer behavior analysis with spontaneous data it generates. However, most studies employ time-consuming content analysis or lexical sentiment analysis. Considering the richness of data and progress of data science, in this paper, we propose a transfer learning based method to explore public attitudes towards alternative meat (AM) using data from social media in China to provide an alternative perspective. We compare traditional machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine with our BERT-based Alternative Meat (BAM) model on the annotated sample. BAM model outperforms others in terms of macro F1 score and accuracy and is employed on the whole dataset later. The sentiment analysis result shows that among 41782 related posts we accumulated, about 42.10% of posts are personal posts consisting of negative, neutral, and positive feelings towards AM with a proportion of 28.77%, 22.91%, and 48.32% respectively. It is less promising compared with the consensus previous studies reach that over half of the Chinese people are positive and few Chinese are negative towards AM. Our findings add to the blooming body of studies suggesting the relationship of people's willingness to try or purchase AM and factors including gender, geography, price, veganism, and food safety. Conspiracy theory is identified for the first time as the main reason for opposition to AM among Chinese consumers. Instead of the booster, traditional vegetarian substitutes especially tofu turn out to be an obstacle for accepting AM with much resemblances. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "Many governments aim to mitigate health risks by attacking nutritional failures. In this article, we exploit a unique natural experiment, the COVID-19 pandemic as an exogenous public health shock, to estimate the learning effects of intensive health information campaigns on nutrient intake during the pandemic. Using data from nearly-one million food purchases in China, our empirical findings strongly support the learning effect in explaining improvements in nutrient intake in the post-COVID-19 period. We conclude that when public health shocks occur, policy makers can boost relevant learning mechanisms by promoting information and education to improve individuals' awareness of preventive health behaviors of a more permanent nature, which can lead to health improvements in a society.

      "Monitoring fruit spoilage can effectively avoid waste and reduce economic losses. Recent studies have proved that the measurement of food volatile compounds is effective to detect food spoilage at its early stage. Indeed, some fast analytical methods have been developed to measure the volatiles released from food, such as proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry, gas-phase infrared spectroscopy, and E-nose. However, these methods can only be applied to measure volatiles in unsealed packages of food and are unable to detect volatiles that are sealed in containers or packages, which are the common situations in food storage and sales. Herein, we investigated a non-intrusive method for detecting food volatiles and monitoring fruit spoilage during storage. A laser directed incident radiation into the food package where it diffused through the box, and absorption spectra were generated. The fingerprint spectra of the molecules in food volatiles were used to determine the concentrations of the volatiles inside the food package. In the experiment, grape spoilage was monitored by measuring changes in oxygen concentration and we successfully predicted the beginning of grape spoilage on the seventh day. The root-mean-square errors of prediction for the storage times of grapes and strawberries were 0.4426 and 0.3079 days, respectively. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "A more accurate HPLC-MS screening method combining functional enzyme assay and affinity ultrafiltration screening assay was developed and applied for the screening of natural product inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase from Cercis chinensis Bunge fruits. The enzyme assay was conducted to prescreen botanical extracts, in which maltose was used as the substrate and detection object. That showed the Cercis chinensis Bunge fruits demonstrated higher alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50=11.941.23 mug/mL) than acarbose (IC50=44.034.37 mug/mL) (n=3, p< 0.05). Subsequently, twelve bioactive components targeting alpha-glucosidase were screened out and identified using affinity ultrafiltration coupled to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The known inhibitor, acarbose, was used as a positive control and competitive ligand to eliminate false positives. Moreover, bindings of the twelve components to the active site of alpha-glucosidase were investigated via molecular docking, which further confirmed the results of the screening assay.

      "Maize mildew is a common phenomenon and it is essential to detect the mildew of a single maize kernel and prevent mildew from spreading around. In this study, a line-scanning Raman hyperspectral imaging system was applied to detect fungal spore quantity of a single maize kernel. Raman spectra were extracted while textural features were obtained to depict the maize mildew. Three kinds of modeling algorithms were used to establish the quantitative model to determine the fungal spore quantity of a single maize kernel. Then competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) was used to optimize characteristic variables. The optimal detection model was established with variables selected from the combination of Raman spectra and textural variance feature by PLSR. Results indicated that it was feasible to detect the fungal spore quantity of a single maize kernel by Raman hyperspectral technique. The study provided an in-situ and nondestructive alternative to detect fungal spore quantity. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "Mildewed maize kernels were common in nature and they were harmful to humans and livestocks. Therefore, it is essential to screen the mildewed maize kernels and improve food security. In this study, Raman hyperspectral imaging technique was used to screen the mildewed maize kernels. Hyperspectral imaging of both embryo-up and embryo-down side were taken into consideration and the effect of their weight ratio on the screening accuracy was compared. Pixel-wise approach and object-wise approach were both analyzed and different variables selection methods were applied to optimize the input variables. Six machine learning classifiers including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), extreme learning machine (ELM), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), and naive Bayes classifier (NBC) were used to establish the screening models. The results exhibited 19 variables selected by competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) method from the weight ratio of 3:7 based on object-wise approach were the most suitable for establishment of screening model with accuracy of 90.63% in the testing set. The microscopic mechanism of mildewed maize kernels was illustrated by micro-fluorescence imaging. The study showed that Raman hyperspectral imaging combined with both embryo-up and embryo-down sides of maize kernels could be used as effective methods to improve the accuracy of screening mildewed maize kernels. Practical Applications. This study provides a comprehensive analysis about the pixels and both sides of maize kernels and gives a nondestructive screening method based on both sides of maize kernels for the mildewed detection. According the mildew of maize kernels, enterprises can effectively improve the storage efficiency of maize kernels to reduce economic losses. Â© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC\n",
      "A hyperspectral imaging system covering 400-1000 nm spectral range was applied for vigour detection of waxy maize seeds after artificial aging. After spectral pre-processing, the characteristic wavelength was selected by uninformative variable elimination (UVE), competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), and random frog (RF) methods. The moisture, starch, protein, and fat contents were measured for each grade of seed, and these values were correlated with the spectrum. Finally, the vitality detection model was established by least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), and random forest (RF). The prediction sets exhibited high classification accuracy (> 99%) for 115 features. The model constructed from the bands significantly correlated with chemical composition (CC), and was better than the classic feature selection methods. The overall results indicated that hyperspectral imaging could be a potential technique to assess seed vigour\n",
      "Identifying geographical origins of red wines made in specific regions is of significance since the false claim of geographical origins has been frequently exposed in China's wine industry. In this work, an untargeted metabolomic approach based on UPLC-QTOF-MS was established to discriminate geographical origins of Chinese red wines. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed significant differences between wine samples from three famous geographical origins in China. The metabolites contributing to the differentiation were screened by orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) with pairwise modeling. 40 and 46 differential metabolites in positive and negative ionization modes were putatively identified as chemical markers. Furthermore, heatmap visualization and OPLS-DA models were constructed based on these identified markers and external verification wine samples from different regions were successfully discriminated, with recognition rate up to 96.7%. This study indicated that UPLC-QTOF-MS-based untargeted metabolomics has great potential for the geographical origin traceability of Chinese red wines. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",

      "Escherichia coli O104:H4 strain 11-3088 encoding Stx2a is epidemiologically related to the foodborne outbreak associated with sprouts in Germany, 2011. Sprouting provides suitable conditions for bacterial growth and may lead to transduction of non-pathogenic strains of E. coli with Stx phages. Although transduction of E. coli by Stx phages in food has been documented, data on the phages from E. coli O104:H4 is limited. This study determined the host range of the bacteriophage Phi11-3088 from E. coli O104:H4 using E. coli O104:H4 Deltastx2::gfp::ampr and demonstrated phage transduction during sprouting. The Phi11-3088Deltastx transduced 5/45 strains, including generic E. coli, pap-positive E. coli O103:H2, ETEC, and S. sonnei. The expression level of Phi11-3088Deltastx differed among lysogens upon induction. Of the 3 highly induced lysogens, the lytic cycle was induced in E. coli O104:H4Deltastx2::gfp::ampr and O103:H2 but not in S. sonnei. E. coli DH5alpha was the only strain susceptible to lytic infection by Phi11-3088Deltastx. To explore the effect of drying and rehydration during seed storage and sprouting on phage induction and transduction, mung beans inoculated with the phage donor E. coli O104:H4Deltastx2::gfp::ampr (8 log CFU/g) were dried, rehydrated, and incubated with the phage recipient E. coli DH5alpha (7 log CFU/g) for 96 h. Sprouted seeds harbored about 3 log CFU/g of putative lysogens that acquired ampicillin resistance. At the end of sprouting, 71 % of putative lysogens encoded gfp, confirming phage transduction. Overall, stx transfer by phages may increase the cell counts of STEC during sprouting by converting generic E. coli to STEC. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "Chlorine and peroxyacetic acid (PAA) are commonly applied in dump tanks and flume systems in commercial fresh apple packing lines; however, little is known about their practical efficacies in dump tank water systems. This study evaluated the efficacies of chlorine and PAA to control Listeria monocytogenes on fresh apples and cross-contamination in simulated dump tank water (SDTW). Efficacies of chlorinated water with initial free chlorine (FC) of 25-100 ppm against L. monocytogenes on apples were significantly impacted by the presence of organic matter, especially for chlorine with 25 ppm initial FC. Chlorine with initial FCs of 50-100 ppm and 2 min contact reduced L. monocytogenes on apples by ~0.9 log10 CFU/apple in SDTW with 1000 ppm chemical oxygen demand (COD). However, 2-5 min wash of chlorine with 25 ppm initial FC only led to ~0.3 log10 CFU/apple reduction of L. monocytogenes on apples in SDTW compared to ~0.9 log10 CFU/apple reduction in clean water. The impacts of organic matter on the antimicrobial efficacy of PAA are concentration dependent. At 20-80 ppm and tested contact times (2-5min), efficacies of PAA against L. monocytogenes were not influenced by organic matter presented in SDTW; 2-5min wash with PAA 80 ppm caused 1.7-1.8 log10 CFU/apple log reduction. However, the anti-Listeria efficacy of 10 ppm PAA was significantly lower in SDTW than in clean water. Sanitizers at the tested concentrations reduced L. monocytogenes transferred from contaminated apples to uncontaminated apples and SDTW but did not eliminate it. There were 1.7-0.6 and 1.0-0.9 log10 CFU/apple of L. monocytogenes transferred to uninoculated apples in SDTW treated with 50-100 ppm FC and 60-80 ppm PAA, respectively, for 2 min, while 3.6-3.7 log10 CFU/apple of L. monocytogenes were transferred to uncontaminated apples in SDTW without any sanitizer treatments. Data indicated that sanitizer treatments in SDTW are effective but can be further improved to ensure the microbial safety of apples. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "Clostridium perfringens is a well-known pathogen that causes foodborne disease. With a high prevalence of contamination in food, an efficient strategy is needed to decontaminate those contaminated foods and control the emergence of foodborne disease. In this study, the C. perfringens-specific lytic phage vB_CpeP_HN02 (designated as phage HN02) was isolated from chicken feces. Electron microscopy and phylogenetic analysis suggested that phage vB_CpeP_HN02 is a novel phage of the family Podoviridae. Phage HN02 had good pH (5-11) and temperature tolerance (< 70 Â°C). Phage HN02 exhibited a broad host range of C. perfringens isolates (42.86%). The complete genome of the phage HN02 was sequenced and revealed a linear double-stranded DNA genome. The 17,754-bp genome (GenBank MW815121) with average GC content of 28.2% includes 22 predicted open reading frames, of which only 10 were annotated with known functions. Phylogenetic analysis of the available C. perfringens phage major capsid protein demonstrated that phage HN02 is closely related to virulent C. perfringens phage phi24R and CPD2. When phage HN02 was applied to chicken meat samples stored at 4 Â°C for 72 h with 1*106 to 1*109 PFU/g, 95% to 99% of C. perfringens were inactivated on chicken meat surfaces after storage at 4 Â°C for 72 h, respectively. It should be noted that C. perfringens could be completely lysed by a high dose of phage HN02 (1*1010 PFU/g) after 48 h treatment in chicken samples. Through the lytic activity testing, phage HN02 showed good antimicrobial effects, and can be used as an antibacterial agent for biocontrol of C. perfringens in meat products.

      "Emulsion-based delivery systems have been reported to improve the solubility, stability and bioavailability of astaxanthin. In this study, the ability of astaxanthin-loaded emulsions (AL) to ameliorate obesity induced by a high-fat and high-sucrose diet was explored, using astaxanthin in the oil phase (ASTA) as a comparison. After the administration of AL, ASTA (30 mg per kg body weight), or saline on normal or obese mice for 4 weeks, the body fat accumulation levels, hepatic lipid contents and hepatic fatty acid profiles were detected, and AL showed better anti-obesity properties than ASTA. In an acute feeding experiment, it was first observed that the astaxanthin concentration of AL was higher than that of ASTA in the blood and liver of obese mice. What's more, AL altered the microbial co-occurrence patterns in obese mice. Some gut microbial modules that were significantly correlated with obesity-related physiological parameters were identified. Overall, the improvement effect of AL on obesity is better than that of ASTA due to their higher oral absorbability and modulating effects on the gut microbiota, and we suggest AL as a more suitable astaxanthin product type for obese bodies.

      "The work aimed to prepare pea protein isolate-chitosan (PPI-CS) nanoparticles, fabricate PPI-CS nanoparticles stabilized Pickering emulsions (PPI-CS Pickering emulsions) and deliver EPA for digestion in vitro and in vivo. The nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and PPI-CS Pickering emulsions were characterized by physicochemical and rheological properties. The results showed that the size of PPI-CS nanoparticles was 194.220.45 nm. Rheological measurement showed that the PPI-CS Pickering emulsions possessed a gel-like network. EPA encapsulated Pickering emulsions (EPA-PE, phi=0.6) exhibited a high retention rate (93%) during storage and performed a lower release rate compared with EPA-PE (phi=0.4) in vitro digestion. The area under the curve of EPA concentration of EPA-PE group and EPA-emulsions (EPA-Em) group was 1.71 and 1.48, respectively. It demonstrated that PPI-CS Pickering emulsions provided the possibility to deliver EPA for digestive absorption. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",
      "Background. Astaxanthin (ASTA) is a kind of food-derived active ingredient (FDAI) with antioxidant and antidiabetic functions. It is nontoxic but its poor solubility and low bioavailability hinder its application in the food industry. In this study, a novel carrier, polyethylene glycol-grafted chitosan (PEG-g-CS) was applied to enhance the bioavailability of astaxanthin. It encapsulated astaxanthin completely by solvent evaporation to manufacture astaxanthin using poly (ethylene glycol)-graft-chitosan nanoparticles (ASTA-PEG-g-CS) nanoparticles to improve absorption. Results. The ASTA-PEG-g-CS nanoparticles were spherical, with a particle size below 200nm and a zeta potential of about-26mV. Polyethylene glycol-grafted chitosan can encapsulate astaxanthin well, and the encapsulated astaxanthin was released rapidly-in 15min in an in vitro release study. In a rat single-pass intestinal perfusion study, a low concentration of ASTA-PEG-g-CS nanoparticle (0.2 mugmL-1) was better absorbed in the intestine. In particular, the jejunum could absorb most astaxanthin without a change in the concentration. An in vivo release study also demonstrated that ASTA-PEG-g-CS nanoparticles enhanced oral bioavailability significantly. Conclusion. This novel carrier, PEG-g-CS, provided a simple way to encapsulate food, which improved the bioavailability of hydrophobic ingredients. Â© 2021 Society of Chemical Industry\n",

      "Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum, TB) is rich in flavonoid glycosides, which are transformed into aglycones and ethyl-beta-rutinoside by endogenous rutin-degrading enzymes. However, the enzymatic reaction efficacy has only been assessed in TB seeds, whilst comprehensive information regarding the catalytic capabilities of other edible tissues is limited. Herein, based on an improved UPLC-MS/MS method, aglycones and ethyl-rutinoside, which are generated from enzyme-induced transglycosylation and hydrolysis reactions, were investigated under different enzymatic treatment parameters in a model reaction system. Subsequently, with previously optimized enzymatic parameters (temperature, 40 Â°C; ethanol concentration, 20%; reaction time, 30 min), the enzymatic catalysis potency was evaluated in different tissues of TB. After enzymatic treatment, the highest yields of ethyl-rutinoside (20.59 mg/g) and aglycones (10.84 mg/g) were observed in the bran of TB. Moreover, the powder of different TB tissues was utilized to produce bread, and bread with TB bran also exhibited the highest levels of aglycones (3.41 mg/g) and ethyl-rutinoside (1.75 mg/g). These results provide good evidence for the optimal utilization of TB bran for the enrichment of foods with ethyl-rutinoside and aglycones for potential health benefits.

      "Tartary buckwheat (TB) bran contains endogenous rutin-degrading enzyme (RDE), which can convert flavonoid glycosides into aglycones and ethyl-rutinoside with potential health benefits. However, the large particle size of TB bran limits its application in food industry. The present study aims to combine micronization and endogenous RDE catalysis for the treatment of TB bran. Here, four TB bran samples, with distinct D50 values (the equivalent volume diameters at 50% cumulative volume) of 359, 239, 168 and 42mum, were prepared by superfine grinding; their physical properties were evaluated. Additionally, with RDE catalysis, the phytochemical compounds, antioxidant and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of the four bran samples were investigated. Compared to the unprocessed material, TB bran (D50, 42mum) exhibited the highest amount of aglycones and ethyl-rutinoside after RDE catalysis, with the total content increased from 1mg/g to 35mg/g. Importantly, after superfine grinding and RDE catalysis, the antioxidant and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of TB bran significantly increased. Theoretically, molecular docking verified that the increased aglycone (quercetin), generated after RDE catalysis, is the predominant alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. Accordingly, the combination of superfine grinding and RDE catalysis is a feasible technology for developing high value-added TB bran products. All rights reserved, Elsevier\n",

       "['Macrolepiota albuminosa (Berk.) Pegler is abundant in active polysaccharides, but little is known about their structures and solution properties. In this study, water-extracted polysaccharides from M. albuminosa (MAWP) were purified into three fractions with structural heterogeneity, which was attributed to the diversity in molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and linkage patterns, further affecting their solution properties. Methylation and NMR analysis revealed MAWP-60p and MAWP-70 were a 3-O-methylated glucomannogalactan and a previously unreported glucomannogalactan, whereas MAWP-80 was elucidated as a branched galactoglucan. Besides, three fractions exhibited random coil conformation in aqueous solution, while MAWP-60p had the highest viscosity due to its highest molecular weight, mean square radius of gyration (Rg) and O-methyl group attached to the backbone. The molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and glycosidic linkages might be the major contributors to the flexibility, molecular size and stereochemistry of mushroom polysaccharide chains. All rights reserved, Elsevier A homogeneous galactoglucan was purified from the alkali-extracted polysaccharides from the basidioma of Macrolepiota albuminosa by gradient ethanol precipitation, whose proposed structure was given for the first time. Results. Showed it had a molecular weight of 210 kDa, and mainly consisted of glucose and galactose. There were abundant filaments, randomly distributed sheet-like and flaky appearance in its surface by SEM observation. Its backbone comprised beta-(1 6)-Glc p, alpha-(1 6)-Gal p and beta-(1 3,6)-Glc p residues at 4:1:1, terminated by beta-(1 3)-Glc p and T-Glc p residues. Rheological measurements suggested its steady flow behavior was highly dependent on concentrations. Newtonian behavior was evident at low concentrations, whereas pseudoplastic behavior was observed at high concentrations. Besides, the X-ray diffraction patterns proved the presence of amorphous structure. The conformational parameters were detected by HPSEC-MALLS-RI, revealing a random coil conformation in NaNO3 aqueous solution. This work provides a theoretical basis for the application of polysaccharides from M. albuminosa in food-and drug-based therapies. All rights reserved, Elsevier A homogeneous beta-glucan (JHMP-70) was obtained from Hypsizygus marmoreus by alkali extraction and ethanol precipitation, and had an apparent molecular weight of 394 kDa. Its fine structure was investigated by FT-IR, methylation combined with GC-MS and 1D and 2D NMR analysis. Results indicated JHMP-70 was a branched beta-(1 6)-glucan substituted at O-3 by the non-reducing beta-Glcp and/or beta-(1 3)-linked beta-Glcp side chains at a ratio of 1:1. SEM observation revealed that there were micro-spherical shapes intertwined with randomly distributed fibrous filaments. Rheological measurements showed that its flow behavior was highly dependent on the concentration. Newtonian behavior was evident at low concentration, whereas pseudoplastic behavior was observed at high concentration. Besides, the addition of salt ions (Na + or Ca2+) significantly decreased the apparent viscosity of JHMP-70 solution. The low viscosity of JHMP-70 was probably attributed to its structural features, including main chain structure, branching degree and side chain length. This work can provide a basis theory to expand the application of the polysaccharides from H. marmoreus in food industry, because their lower viscosity and superior fluidity are desired in beverage products to impart stability against phase separation without compromising other sensorial properties.

A high conversion (exceeding 94%) of beta-sitosterol with a vinyl group was achieved, in the presence of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL), at low temperature (35 Â°C) within 30 min. Subsequently, the maximum conversion of phytosterol polyol esters (>94%) was obtained using alkaline protease from Bacillus subtilis at 65 Â°C. Phytosterol polyol esters had enhanced thermal stability (up to an above 355 Â°C) and excellent water solubility (4.6-7.9 mM at 35 Â°C). Moreover, obvious increases in the bioaccessibility (41.5-63.6%) and intestinal uptake (5.2-6.5%) were observed using a simulated gastrointestinal digestion/Caco-2 cell model. These results highlighted the key role of hydrophilic structural modifications on physicochemical properties and absorption of phytosterols. All rights reserved, Elsevier The existence of microwave non-thermal effects in food processing is still debated. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the conformation, electrostatic profiles, and intramolecular hydrogen bonds (intra-HB) of glucose in aqueous solution under alternating electric fields of microwaves ranging from 0 to 109 V/m at 2.45 GHz. The results showed a field-induced threshold of 109 V/m. At the threshold, alternating microwaves reoriented the flexible moieties and thus enhanced the intra-HB. The conformational transition among gg, gt, and tg conformers at 109 V/m possibly resulted from the uneven electrostatic potential and the increased intra-HB. In practice, the maximum electric field of microwaves is several times weaker than the threshold, verifying the absence of microwave non-thermal effects for glucose molecules in food processing. This study provides a novel strategy to evaluate the potential non-thermal effects of microwaves in food processing and the related underlying food safety issues.

Cooking properties analysis showed that water absorption ratio and cooking loss of FCNs decreased at first and then increased with the increase of gluten addition. Compared to FCNs with 1% and 5% gluten additions, recooked FCNs with 3% gluten addition had a similar texture property to control sample, and they had the highest tensile force and distance, and the lowest surface tackiness. Meanwhile, the recooked FCNs (3% gluten addition) had smaller pores, denser and more complex gluten network, and their force and elasticity during chewing were the best in sensory evaluation. Low-field 1H nuclear magnetic resonance showed that the lowest T21 (0.11ms) and T23 (51.11ms) were found in the recooked FCNs (3% gluten addition). Furthermore, the alpha-helix of samples increased while the beta-sheet and random coil decreased, the glutenin macropolymer content of recooked FCNs increased at first and then decreased with adding gluten. These results indicated that the recooked FCNs (3% gluten addition) had a lower surface tackiness, higher sensory scores, and better quality. All rights reserved, Elsevier',\n",

Under the optimal conditions, all target analytes had a good linear relationship, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.9900 to 0.9940, the limits of detection were 0.42-5.16 ng/mL, the limits of quantification were 1.39-17.18 ng/mL, and the spiked recoveries of seven target compounds in real samples ranged from 70.04 to 94.95%. The intra-day precision RSD variations ranged from 0.13 to 0.70%, and the inter-day precision RSDs were between 0.38 and 1.4%, which had good reproducibility and repeatability. In general, DMSPE is a convenient, efficient, and environmentally friendly method for sample preparation, which has the potential for microextraction. Â©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021 In this study, we investigated the influence of various factors on the formation of 2-monochloro-1,3-propanediol and 3-monochloro-1,2-propanediol (MCPD) esters in Chinese fried dough sticks. The results showed types of oil significantly affected the content of MCPD esters in fried dough sticks, with palm oil responsible for the highest. As well, temperature and time affected the content of MCPD esters (P< 0.05). Treatment at 200 Â°C for 4 min resulted in 1.87 mg/kg 3-MCPD esters and 0.68 mg/kg 2-MCPD esters, respectively. The dough containing 1 g/100 g NaCl was fried at 180 Â°C for 4 min, resulting in elevated levels of MCPD esters. MCPD esters in fried dough sticks constantly varied during the 8-h cycle in 3 consecutive days and the 12-h frying cycle. Pearson correlation test showed 3-MCPD esters had a positive correlation with 2-MCPD esters (R = 0.920), which allowed 3-MCPD esters to be a representative index of MCPD esters. A good correlation between the acid value (AV), p-anisidine value (p-AnV), color (DeltaEpsilon) of frying oil and MCPD esters in fried dough sticks was also found. The changes of MCPD esters of fried dough sticks were assumed to be caused by oxidation and hydrolysis of oil during frying. All rights reserved, Elsevier We used a risk-benefit model to evaluate the effects of different farming methods and consumption habits on dietary risk of Chinese mitten crab. In this study, we found that cadmium levels in the total edible parts and brown meat were 0.029-0.462 mg/kg and 0.017-1.694 mg/kg, respectively. Cadmium exposure experiment showed that brown meat was the main enrichment site of cadmium. Fatty acid test found that the EPA+ DHA content in total edible parts fed with formulated feed and iced trash fish was 19.64 3.62 mg/g and 28.72 2.30 mg/g (p> 0.05), respectively, and that in brown meat was 27.66 5.16 mg/g and 40.15 3.50 mg/g (p> 0.05), respectively. According to the risk-benefit model analysis, the dietary risk of brown meat under the two breeding methods is relatively high, but the risk quotient is less than 1. All rights reserved, Elsevier Sous-vide cooking is a highly praised method used to cook muscle foods because of its desired effect of providing better sensory properties by maintaining texture. In this study, we further explored the effect of water on texture by revealing the mechanisms of moisture migration. Low field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) showed that the nonflowing water in sous-vide cooking hairtail was 2.36 0.33% higher than that in traditional cooking. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to clarify the law of moisture migration induced by temperature, and the moisture migration of the sous-vide cooking hairtail was slower during the holding heating stage. The microstructure explained the change rules of the texture. The degree of change was consistent with the moisture migration level. Digitalizing analysis quantitatively verified the effect of sous-vide cooking on the hairtail microstructure. The low moisture migration rate of sous-vide cooking resulted in a less damaged microstructure of the hairtail, manifesting as a desirable texture. Practical Application. LF-NMR and MRI showed that sous-vide hairtails exhibited a lower moisture migration rate. The holding heating stage only slightly changed the microstructure of the hairtail. The digitalizing analysis confirmed the moisture migration mechanisms. Heat-induced protein denaturation was closely related to the water state. Â© 2022 Institute of Food Technologists Relationship between heat/mass transfer and color change during the drying process of Radix Paeoniae Alba (RPA) slice was studied. The results show that drying temperature and moisture content are the main factors affecting the color of the sample. The lightness value (L) decreases as the moisture content decreases, while the red-green value (a) and yellow-blue value (b) increase with the decrease in moisture content. The higher the temperature, the lower the L, while the higher a and b, and the greater the total color difference (DeltaE). The total color difference values at 60Â°C, 80Â°C and 100Â°C were 5.58, 6.99 and 9.05, respectively. Based on the moisture change, a model coupling heat/mass transfer and color change was presented to illustrate the results during the drying process.

Merr starch (APS) with different degrees of substitution (DS [0, 0.02, 0.24, 0.40]) and evaluate in vitro digestibility, pasting, and thermal properties of citrate APS. The citrate APS surface become rougher. Citric acid modification led to significant changes in molecular and crystal structure citric acid treatment significantly reduced molecular weight of APS, and the molecular weight was decreased with increasing the DS. The citrate APS possessed a lower pasting viscosity and a higher resistant starch (RS) content. RS content of APS citrate was increased with increasing the DS, and the maximum RS content reached 74.21%. Citric acid modification improved thermal stability of the APS. These results suggested that the structural alterations might be responsible for changes of APS citrate properties and the citrate APS was an excellent potential food additive that had desirable functional properties and high RS content. Novelty impact statement. The non-conventional APS was modified using citric acid. The citrate APS possessed a lower pasting viscosity and had a higher RS content, up to 74.21%.

       " 'The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is effective in reducing the fishy malodor of sea products. However, the biotransformation pathways are still unclear. The seaweed B. Fusco-purpurea was taken as an example to investigate the chemical transformation pathways for the deodorization process with S. cerevisiae fermentation. Sensory evaluation, GC-MS, GC-MS-O and odor activity value (OAV) analyses showed the fishy odorants were 1-octen-3-ol, (E)-2-nonenal, 2,4-decadienal, 2-pentylfuran, 2-octen-1-ol and nonanal. The removal of fishy malodor was related to the reactions of reduction, dehydrogenation, deformylation-oxygenation and ester syntheses via catalysis of aldehyde dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenases, epoxide hydrolase, aldehyde deformylating-oxygenase, enone reductase, oxidases, dehydrogenases, aldo-keto reductases, ester synthase and acyltransferase. Interestingly, for the first time, it was found that 3,5-octadien-2-one transformed to 6-octen-2-one; and 2-pentylfuran transformed to o-cymene and hexyl acetate. Our findings enrich the knowledge for the removal of fishy malodor from sea products such as seaweeds. All rights reserved, Elsevier In this study, the ameliorative effect of water bamboo shoot (WBS) on acute alcoholism mice was investigated and potential biological compounds were explored. Results showed that extraction methods significantly affected the active substances contents and bioactivities of WBS. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that alkali extract (NE) obtained the highest score, therefore, it was selected for further analysis. Animal experiments showed that NE demonstrated ameliorative effects on acute alcoholism mice as evident by significantly elevated activities of dehydrogenase (alcohol dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase) and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase), whereas significantly reduced the levels of aminotransferase (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase) in serum. The potential bioactive activity compounds of NE were explored by UPLC-MS/MS and bioinformatics analysis. Butyl isobutyl phthalate vanillin, ferulic acid methyl ester might be the major compounds in NE on alleviating acute alcoholism. These results indicated that WBS possesses potential ameliorating effect on acute alcoholism. All rights reserved, Elsevier An inclusion system of embedding ferulic acid into beta-cyclodextrin (FACD) with different host-guest stoichiometries was prepared by a co-precipitation method. Then, the physicochemical properties and release kinetics of the FACD were evaluated. The results of thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) proved the successful embedding of FA into the beta-cyclodextrin matrix. Four mathematical models were applied to adjust the ferulic acid release profile and identify preferential kinetics. The results of physicochemical properties confirmed the successful formation of the complexes. The loading capacity (LC) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of the inclusion complex (1:0.5) were 41.03.28 mg g-1 and 52.12.31%, respectively, which were significantly higher than other molar ratios. The release behaviour revealed that loaded FA molecules under various host-guest stoichiometries obey different release models. While lower host-guest stoichiometry (1:0.5) provided desirable EE, the moderate host-guest stoichiometry (1:1) exhibited faster release behaviour. The FACD inclusion complex could be a promising bioactive material for food preservation. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 Different approaches have been adopted to overcome the inherent shortcomings of native starches, and blending of different native starches has attracted much attention due to the \"clean-label\" feature and the low processing effort and cost. In the current study, we blended high-amylose maize starch (HA7) with wheat (WHE) or potato (POT) starch at 1:1 ratio (dry weight basis; dwb) and then comprehensively examined their thermal properties, pasting and gelling behaviors over the heating temperature range of 95-140Â°C, and in vitro digestibility in comparison with three individual starches. With an excess amount of water (starch: water = 1:3), gelatinization of individual starches generally appeared to be independent in the two starch blends. An exceptionally low percentage of retrogradation was observed for gelatinized HA7-WHE blend during cold storage, which could be partially ascribed to the formation of a large amount of amylose-lipid complexes (ALC). Greater resistance to thermal degradation and thixotropic breakdown during pasting at 120Â°C was found with HA7-WHE blend when compared with HA7-POT blend. Both starch blends could form gels with moderate strength (74.3-109.4g) after cooking at 120 and 140Â°C. The determined resistant starch (RS) and slowly digestible starch (SDS) contents of water-boiled HA7-WHE blend were higher than the calculated values when assuming simple additivity of the two starches. The interactions at both granular and molecular levels and the presence of ALC were responsible for the reported unique techno-functional attributes of HA7-WHE blend, which rendered it suitable for diverse food and industrial applications. All rights reserved, Elsevier High oleic acid (OA) peanut seeds (PS) can be beneficial for human health. However, chemical variations in high-OA PS after domestic cooking are not fully understood. In order to investigate the impact of different cooking methods on the chemical profile of high-OA PS, widely established metabolomics approach was employed to identify the relative contents of PS metabolites. Herein, 630 metabolites within 27 categories were characterized in PS, of which 141, 157, 402 differential metabolites were observed in each treatment group (boiling, baking, and frying) when compared to the raw seed. Accordingly, bioactive substances were maximally preserved in baked high-OA PS. Further conventional methods (HPLC-UV/GC-MS) quantified the absolute composition of amino and fatty acids, verifying the reliability of metabolomic analysis. Collectively, the understanding of the phytochemical substances in relation to the domestic cooking method established a foundation for future high-OA PS processing. All rights reserved, Elsevier High oleic acid (OA) peanut seed (PS), contains a higher ratio of oleic acid (C18:1) compared to general PS, which is favored by consumers due to its health benefits. However, comprehensive lipid metabolite profiles of high-OA PS, once they have been processed via domestic cooking methods, have never been produced. To establish a scientific guide for the selection of the most appropriate processing method for high-OA PS, lipidomics was performed to identify 706 lipid metabolites in high-OA PS following boiling, baking and frying, between the three groups, 75, 175 and 242 lipid metabolites were differentially expressed respectively. Additionally, 46glycerolipids with C18:1molecular were observed in the lipid profiles of the treatment groups compared to the raw sample. Further evaluation of seven lipid peroxides and six antioxidant status of each testing group suggested that boiled PS retained the highest levels of lipids and antioxidant activity. Following these findings, boiling appears to be an appropriate processing method when attempting to conserve the beneficial substances found in the PS. Finally, the levels of major free fatty acids present in high-OA PS, were jointly quantified by conventional methods (GC-MS) and lipidomic analysis. FA/C16:0 levels were similar, FA/C18:0, FA/C18:1 displayed opposite results, FA/C18:2 levels increased following frying and FA/C18:3 levels were down regulated once the PS was boiled. This indicates that GC-MS is a potential method of validation for the results of lipidomic analysis. Conclusively, this in depth understanding of lipid content in relation to domestic cooking methods has provided a foundation for the processing of high-OA peanut products.

Twelve phenolic derivatives were identified in the free extract, including Nâ€²-caffeoyl-N-feruloylspermidine, Nâ€², N-dicaffeoylspermidine and N-(p-coumaroyl) serotonin reported for the first time in proso millets. Fifteen phenolic acid derivatives were found in the bound fraction with p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid being the major phenolic acids, as well as four ferulic acid dimers (DFAs) detected for the first time in proso millets. The total phenolic content (TPC) of the soluble and insoluble phenolic fractions varied from 592 to 1510 mg ferulic acid equivalents (FAE)/kg dry weight (DW) and 1146-2436 mg FAE/kg DW, respectively. The total flavonoid content (TFC) of the proso millets ranged from 284 to 978 mg rutin equivalents (RE)/kg DW. DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays were applied to determine in vitro antioxidant activities for all the phenolic extracts, and the antioxidant levels were attributed to TPCs. The diverse phenolics contributed to the antioxidant properties of proso millet, which can serve as viable functional food ingredients. All rights reserved, Elsevier.',\n",
       " 'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the major cause of global chronic hepatic injury, has obtained increasing attention while the current drug treatment still laid safety hazards. Major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs), the water-soluble proteins enriched in royal jelly (RJ), were applied to study its effects on improving NAFLD in the NAFLD mouse model. Herein, we demonstrated that intaking of 250-500mg/kg/day MRJPs significantly decreased the rate of obesity, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. Next, TOF to MRM (\"TM\") widely targeted metabolomics (untargeted metabolomics + widely targeted metabolomics) was further used to explore the potential mechanism, and we found that 500mg/kg MRJPs alleviated lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation mainly by regulating the metabolisms of alpha-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, by detecting multiple oxidative stress factors and inflammatory cytokines, we found that MRJPs indeed exerted antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Together, we demonstrated that MRJPs could mediate the progress of NAFLD through the \"multi-component-multi-target-multi-pathway\" mechanism, which could be considered as an ideal functional food in alleviating NAFLD. Practical applications. Royal jelly (RJ) is a bee product with high nutritional value. Major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) are water-soluble proteins in RJ. Our research showed that MRJPs significantly ameliorated NAFLD induced by a high-fat diet in mice, suggesting that MRJPs could be used as an active ingredient to help improve NAFLD, which was beneficial for the development of related functional foods and the economic value of RJ. Moreover, the metabolic pathways involved in the ameliorative effect of MRJPs were investigated, which provided new ideas for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Â© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC Gut microbiota-involved metabolism and intestinal absorption affecting bioaccessibility of triadimefon in strawberry and grape were investigated for the first time by coupling the in vitro digestion model with the Caco-2 cell model. Results showed that the gut microbiota decreased the bioaccessibility of triadimefon in strawberry by 31.00% but failed in grape, probably due to a negative modulation of the colon bacterial activity by dietary components in grapes. A strain of triadimefon-degrading bacteria, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, was isolated from the gut microbiota and its degradation products were profiled. This study also clarified a significant reduction in transepithelial transport (up to 32.81%) of triadimefon as a result of the barrier effect of gut microbiota. These findings provide new insights on the function of the gut microbiota in pesticide bioaccessibility and highlight the importance of including gut microbiota in pesticide residue risk assessments. All rights reserved, Elsevier The homeostasis of circadian clock linked to bile acid (BA) metabolism and gut microbiota has profound benefits in maintaining the health status of the host. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevention and regulation of apple polyphenol extract (APE) on BA metabolism and gut microbiota by means of modulation of circadian rhythms in mice. Eighty male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into four groups: 24-hour ad libitum standard chow group (AC), ad libitum HFD group (AF), restricted 12 h daytime HFD feeding group (DF), and daytime HFD feeding with APE treatment group (DP). Five weeks later, the mice were sacrificed at 6 h intervals over a 24 h period. The results showed that APE decreased body weight and induced daily rhythms of Cry1 and Roralpha in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and Clock, Cry1 and Cry2 in the ileum in daytime HFD mice. APE significantly increased the expression of hepatic FXR at ZT0 and BSEP at ZT12 and inhibited the expression of ileac FXR at ZT12, reduced levels of fecal TBAs, secondary BAs, and unconjugated BAs at ZT0. Meanwhile, APE regulated the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota, and increased the abundance of probiotics. Therefore, our work revealed that APE as a clock-regulating natural compound could modulate BA metabolism and gut microbiota and protect against circadian disruption in a clock-dependent manner. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 To investigate the potential role of apple polyphenol extract (APE) in the prevention and alleviation of circadian rhythm disturbances, eighty male C57BL/6mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were randomized into four groups: 24 h ad libitum feeding (AL), 12 h restricted nighttime feeding (NF) or daytime feeding (DF), and daytime feeding with APE intragastric administration (DF-APE). Five weeks later, the mice were sacrificed at 6 h intervals over 24 h. Disrupted fluctuations in serum lipid profiles and hormones, along with desynchronization of circadian clock genes and metabolic genes were observed after daytime HFD feeding. However, APE treatment improved hepatic steatosis and recovered circadian rhythms of Cry1/2, and genes Acc and Hsl related to lipid synthesis and hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters, and Cyp7a1 in bile acid synthesis. In conclusion, the present study provides new evidence revealing that the circadian clock might be a novel target for APE to regulate metabolic homeostasis.

In addition, the results of an animal test of diabetes mellitus II (DM II) with ACP showed that the total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and fasting blood glucose and water in the serum of mice with ACP were significantly lower than those in the model group; the serum SOD, hepatic glycogen, and insulin of mice added with ACP were significantly higher than those in the model group. More importantly, ACP had no significant adverse effects on organ index and liver and kidney tissue morphology in mice. These results suggest that ACP can be used as a potential functional food component for the prevention or treatment of diabetes. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021 Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ameliorating effects of three yeast strains, Saccharomyces cerevisiae I4, Clavispora lusitaniae 30 and Pichia kudriavzevii 11, isolated from traditional fermented dairy food in Xinjiang, China, on the ulcerative colitis symptoms of Balb/c mice treated by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Among which, S. cerevisiae I4 had good tolerance to simulated gastrointestinal juice and strong adhesion to HT-29 cells monolayers. Furthermore, the three yeast strains were oral administered to Balb/c mice with DSS induced colitis. The weight loss, colon shortening and histological injury of colitis mice were ameliorated. Then, oral administration of S. cerevisiae I4 improved the immune state by reducing the contents of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta and increasing immunoglobulin. The relative expression of intestinal barrier proteins Claudin-1, Occludin and Zonula Occludins-1 (ZO-1) of the mice enhanced, and the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) content such as Propionic acid, Butyric acid, Isobutyric acid and Isovaleric acid in the feces of the mice increased to varying degrees, after S. cerevisiae I4 treatment compared with the model group of drinking 3% DSS water without yeast treatment. Moreover, S. cerevisiae I4 treatment lifted the proportion of beneficial bacteria such asMuribaculaceae, Lactobacillaceae and Rikenellaceae in the intestinal tract of the mice, the abundance of harmful bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Turicibacter was decreased. These results suggested that S. cerevisiae I4 could alleviate DSS induced colitis in mice by enhancing intestinal barrier function and regulating intestinal flora balance. Â© 2022 by the authors.

       " \"In order to develop the tyrosinase inhibitors with potential application in food industry, a series of stilbene-hydroxypyridinone hybrids were prepared. Among these compounds, 1h was found to possess the most potent tyrosinase inhibitory effect on both monophenolase and diphenolase activities, with IC50 values of 2.72muM and 15.86muM, respectively. The inhibitory effect of 1h on monophenolase activity was 4.6 times that of kojic acid. An inhibition kinetic assay indicated that 1h was a mixed-type and reversible inhibitor. The copper-binding and reducing ability assays, molecular docking study, intrinsic and ANS-binding fluorescence assays indicated that copper coordination and reduction is likely to be the causative mechanism for 1h-induced inhibition on tyrosinase. The results of color measurement and browning index determination indicated that treatment with 1h retarded effectively the browning of freshly-cut apples during their storage. Meanwhile, PPO and POD activities in apple slices were found to be effectively inhibited. All rights reserved, Elsevier This study investigated the impact of meat processing surface bacteria (MPB) on biofilm formation by non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), and potential links between biofilm formation by STEC and biofilm-related genes in their genomes. Biofilm development by 50 MPB and 6 STEC strains in mono- and co-cultures was assessed by the crystal violet staining method, and their expression of curli and cellulose was determined using the Congo red agar method. Genes (n = 141) associated with biofilm formation in the STEC strains were profiled. Biofilm formation in general correlated with cellulose and curli expression in both mono- and co-cultures. Most MPB strains had antagonistic effects on the biofilm formation of the STEC strains. Of the genes investigated, 81% were common among the STEC strains and there seems to be a gene-redundancy in biofilm formation. The inability of the O26 strain to form biofilms could be due to mutations in the rpoS gene. Truncation in the mlrA gene in the O145 strain seems not affecting its biofilm formation alone or with MPB. The O45 strain, despite having the greatest number of biofilm-related genes, did not form measurable biofilms. Overall, biofilm formation of STEC was affected by curli-cellulose expression and companion strains. All rights reserved, Elsevier Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a human foodborne pathogen, and it can form a mature biofilm on food and food contact surfaces to enhance their resistance to antibacterial agents. In this study, the effect of anti-biofilm enzymes (combined lipase, cellulase and proteinase K) on the inhibition and eradication of pathogen biofilm was evaluated. The biofilm content of V. parahaemolyticus showed the highest level at the incubation time of 24 h, and the combined enzymes significantly inhibited the biofilm's development. The biofilm's inhibition and eradication rate at an incubation time of 24 h was 89.7% and 66.9%, respectively. The confocal laser scanning microscopic images confirmed that the microcolonies' aggregation and the adhesion of biofilm were inhibited with the combined enzyme treatment. Furthermore, combined enzymes also decreased the concentration of exopolysaccharide (EPS) and disrupted the EPS matrix network, wherein the expression of the EPS-related gene, cpsA-J, was likewise suppressed. The combined enzymes showed an excellent inhibition effect of V. parahaemolyticus biofilm on different carriers, with the highest inhibition rate of 59.35% on nonrust steel plate. This study demonstrates that the combined enzyme of lipase, cellulase and proteinase K could be a novel candidate to overcome biofilm's problem of foodborne pathogens in the food industry.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive pathogen, that usually adheres to stainless steel (SS), and other abiotic surfaces in food processing that undergo repeated cleaning and cause the spread of Listeria. Through the enumeration of biofilm cells, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) component and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of biofilms, it was found that the ratio of cells and extracellular matrix is affected by nutrition status. Regardless of the temperature, all strains exhibited a higher adhesion ability when exposed to 10-fold diluted TSB-YE (DTSB-YE, nutrition deficiency). Three hour initial adhesion was significantly positively correlated with biofilm formation (p<0.01). DTSB-YE enhances initial attachment and subsequently promotes biofilm formation. The SEM analysis also showed that in DTSB-YE the adhesion and covered area of the attached cells were higher than those in TSB-YE (rich media). The amount of both extracellular polysaccharides and proteins was significantly higher when incubated in DTSB-YE than TSB-YE. The highest biofilm formation of Lm83 was observed in DTSBYE independent of temperature. The effects of nutrition deficiency on the expression of critical biofilm-associated genes of Lm 83 planktonic and biofilm cells were measured. The gene expression levels of inlA and sigB in biofilm cells in TSB-YE and DTSB-YE were approximately 95.7% and 88.0% and 42.2% and 45.7% lower than those in planktonic cells, respectively. However, the expression of inlA in DTSB-YE was significantly higher (p<0.05) than that in TSB-YE for the same cell state. Interestingly, the gene expression of motB was considerably higher in DTSB-YE than in TSBYE, regardless of the state. These results indicate that better cell motility in nutrient deficiencies might facilitate the cell aggression to promote biofilm formation. All rights reserved, Elsevier Panax notoginseng has been used both as a traditional medicine and as a functional food for hundreds of years in Asia. However, the active constituents from P. notoginseng and their pharmacologic properties still need to be further explored. In this study, one new dammarane-type triterpenoid saponin (1), along with fourteen known analogs (2-15) were isolated and identified from the roots of P. notoginseng. The anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenetic and anti-dengue virus effects of these isolated compounds were further evaluated. Compounds 1, 3, 5-7 and 10-12 exerted anti-inflammatory effects in two different zebrafish inflammatory models. Among them, 11, with the most significant activities, alleviated the inflammatory response by blocking the MyD88/NF-kappaB and STAT3 pathways. Moreover, compound 15 showed anti-angiogenetic activities in Tg (fli1:EGFP) and Tg (flk1:GFP) zebrafish, while 3 and 5 only inhibited angiogenesis in Tg (fli1:EGFP) zebrafish. Additionally, compounds 1, 3, 6, 8, 9 and 12 suppressed the replication of Dengue virus either at the viral adsorption and entry stages or at the intracellular replication step. In conclusion, these findings enrich knowledge of the diversity of saponins in P. notoginseng and suggest that the dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins from P. notoginseng may be developed as potential functional foods to treat inflammation, angiogenesis or dengue-related diseases.

       " 'This work investigated the effects of inulin on the water migration, ice crystal formation, and freeze-thaw stability of surimi under different additive amounts and polymerization degrees (DP). All the three types of inulin were shown to restrict water fluidity in surimi in a DP and amount dependent manner, and 10% long-chain inulin (L-INU) had the most conspicuous restriction on water migration. Short-chain inulin (S-INU) and nature inulin (N-INU) not only showed a more prominent effect than L-INU on decreasing freezing temperature and preventing ice crystal growth under an amount-effect relationship, but also were detected to interact with proteins to facilitate their stabilization. Freeze-thaw stability tests demonstrated all the three types of inulin could significantly inhibit the deterioration of surimi quality. After several freeze-thaw cycles, 8% L-INU showed the most significant inhibitory effect on thawing water loss, superior to commercial cryoprotectant (CC) (sucrose plus sorbitol), while 8% S-INU and N-INU were comparable to CC and showed better performance than L-INU in terms of chrominance of surimi, breaking force and deformation, water holding capacity, texture properties and whiteness of surimi gel. Overall, 8% S-INU can better maintain the surimi gel properties and 8% L-INU can better restrain the thawing water loss. These results suggest the potential of inulin as a promising cryoprotectant candidate in the frozen surimi industry.

However, it has low bioavailability due to its insolubility in aqueous solution and rapid degradation profile. In this paper, an oil-in-water (O/W) Pickering emulsion (PE) was fabricated ultrasonically with different cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) concentrations to investigate its effect on the physicochemical properties of PE and the storage stability of curcumin. The CNC-PE produced remained stable for at least one month. The highest encapsulation efficiency of curcumin in CNC-PE was found to exceed 99%. For storage of curcumin containing CNC-PE under dark conditions, good stability of curcumin was observed with a half-life of 98.47 d, reflecting a nearly 20-fold improvement as compared to other existing PE systems. On the other hand, storage under visible light, UV light, and at elevated temperature (50Â°C) increased the degradation rate of encapsulated curcumin following the order: 50Â°C > UV light > visible light > dark. Our findings elucidated the promising potential of CNC-PE as a food-safe delivery system for sensitive lipophilic bioactive compounds. All rights reserved, Elsevier',\n",

Considering the richness of data and progress of data science, in this paper, we propose a transfer learning based method to explore public attitudes towards alternative meat (AM) using data from social media in China to provide an alternative perspective. We compare traditional machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine with our BERT-based Alternative Meat (BAM) model on the annotated sample. BAM model outperforms others in terms of macro F1 score and accuracy and is employed on the whole dataset later. The sentiment analysis result shows that among 41782 related posts we accumulated, about 42.10% of posts are personal posts consisting of negative, neutral, and positive feelings towards AM with a proportion of 28.77%, 22.91%, and 48.32% respectively. It is less promising compared with the consensus previous studies reach that over half of the Chinese people are positive and few Chinese are negative towards AM. Our findings add to the blooming body of studies suggesting the relationship of people's willingness to try or purchase AM and factors including gender, geography, price, veganism, and food safety. Conspiracy theory is identified for the first time as the main reason for opposition to AM among Chinese consumers. Instead of the booster, traditional vegetarian substitutes especially tofu turn out to be an obstacle for accepting AM with much resemblances.

In this article, we exploit a unique natural experiment, the COVID-19 pandemic as an exogenous public health shock, to estimate the learning effects of intensive health information campaigns on nutrient intake during the pandemic. Using data from nearly-one million food purchases in China, our empirical findings strongly support the learning effect in explaining improvements in nutrient intake in the post-COVID-19 period. We conclude that when public health shocks occur, policy makers can boost relevant learning mechanisms by promoting information and education to improve individuals' awareness of preventive health behaviors of a more permanent nature, which can lead to health improvements in a society. All rights reserved, Elsevier Monitoring fruit spoilage can effectively avoid waste and reduce economic losses. Recent studies have proved that the measurement of food volatile compounds is effective to detect food spoilage at its early stage. Indeed, some fast analytical methods have been developed to measure the volatiles released from food, such as proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry, gas-phase infrared spectroscopy, and E-nose. However, these methods can only be applied to measure volatiles in unsealed packages of food and are unable to detect volatiles that are sealed in containers or packages, which are the common situations in food storage and sales. Herein, we investigated a non-intrusive method for detecting food volatiles and monitoring fruit spoilage during storage. A laser directed incident radiation into the food package where it diffused through the box, and absorption spectra were generated. The fingerprint spectra of the molecules in food volatiles were used to determine the concentrations of the volatiles inside the food package. In the experiment, grape spoilage was monitored by measuring changes in oxygen concentration and we successfully predicted the beginning of grape spoilage on the seventh day. The root-mean-square errors of prediction for the storage times of grapes and strawberries were 0.4426 and 0.3079 days, respectively. All rights reserved, Elsevier A more accurate HPLC-MS screening method combining functional enzyme assay and affinity ultrafiltration screening assay was developed and applied for the screening of natural product inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase from Cercis chinensis Bunge fruits. The enzyme assay was conducted to prescreen botanical extracts, in which maltose was used as the substrate and detection object. That showed the Cercis chinensis Bunge fruits demonstrated higher alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50=11.941.23 mug/mL) than acarbose (IC50=44.034.37 mug/mL) (n=3, p< 0.05). Subsequently, twelve bioactive components targeting alpha-glucosidase were screened out and identified using affinity ultrafiltration coupled to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The known inhibitor, acarbose, was used as a positive control and competitive ligand to eliminate false positives. Moreover, bindings of the twelve components to the active site of alpha-glucosidase were investigated via molecular docking, which further confirmed the results of the screening assay. All rights reserved, Elsevier Maize mildew is a common phenomenon and it is essential to detect the mildew of a single maize kernel and prevent mildew from spreading around. In this study, a line-scanning Raman hyperspectral imaging system was applied to detect fungal spore quantity of a single maize kernel. Raman spectra were extracted while textural features were obtained to depict the maize mildew. Three kinds of modeling algorithms were used to establish the quantitative model to determine the fungal spore quantity of a single maize kernel. Then competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) was used to optimize characteristic variables. The optimal detection model was established with variables selected from the combination of Raman spectra and textural variance feature by PLSR. Results indicated that it was feasible to detect the fungal spore quantity of a single maize kernel by Raman hyperspectral technique. The study provided an in-situ and nondestructive alternative to detect fungal spore quantity. All rights reserved, Elsevier Mildewed maize kernels were common in nature and they were harmful to humans and livestocks. Therefore, it is essential to screen the mildewed maize kernels and improve food security. In this study, Raman hyperspectral imaging technique was used to screen the mildewed maize kernels. Hyperspectral imaging of both embryo-up and embryo-down side were taken into consideration and the effect of their weight ratio on the screening accuracy was compared. Pixel-wise approach and object-wise approach were both analyzed and different variables selection methods were applied to optimize the input variables. Six machine learning classifiers including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), extreme learning machine (ELM), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), and naive Bayes classifier (NBC) were used to establish the screening models. The results exhibited 19 variables selected by competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) method from the weight ratio of 3:7 based on object-wise approach were the most suitable for establishment of screening model with accuracy of 90.63% in the testing set. The microscopic mechanism of mildewed maize kernels was illustrated by micro-fluorescence imaging. The study showed that Raman hyperspectral imaging combined with both embryo-up and embryo-down sides of maize kernels could be used as effective methods to improve the accuracy of screening mildewed maize kernels. Practical Applications. This study provides a comprehensive analysis about the pixels and both sides of maize kernels and gives a nondestructive screening method based on both sides of maize kernels for the mildewed detection. According the mildew of maize kernels, enterprises can effectively improve the storage efficiency of maize kernels to reduce economic losses. Â© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC A hyperspectral imaging system covering 400-1000 nm spectral range was applied for vigour detection of waxy maize seeds after artificial aging. After spectral pre-processing, the characteristic wavelength was selected by uninformative variable elimination (UVE), competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), and random frog (RF) methods. The moisture, starch, protein, and fat contents were measured for each grade of seed, and these values were correlated with the spectrum. Finally, the vitality detection model was established by least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), and random forest (RF). The prediction sets exhibited high classification accuracy (> 99%) for 115 features. The model constructed from the bands significantly correlated with chemical composition (CC), and was better than the classic feature selection methods. The overall results indicated that hyperspectral imaging could be a potential technique to assess seed vigour Identifying geographical origins of red wines made in specific regions is of significance since the false claim of geographical origins has been frequently exposed in China's wine industry. In this work, an untargeted metabolomic approach based on UPLC-QTOF-MS was established to discriminate geographical origins of Chinese red wines. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed significant differences between wine samples from three famous geographical origins in China. The metabolites contributing to the differentiation were screened by orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) with pairwise modeling. 40 and 46 differential metabolites in positive and negative ionization modes were putatively identified as chemical markers. Furthermore, heatmap visualization and OPLS-DA models were constructed based on these identified markers and external verification wine samples from different regions were successfully discriminated, with recognition rate up to 96.7%. This study indicated that UPLC-QTOF-MS-based untargeted metabolomics has great potential for the geographical origin traceability of Chinese red wines. All rights reserved, Elsevier\",\n",
       " 'Escherichia coli O104:H4 strain 11-3088 encoding Stx2a is epidemiologically related to the foodborne outbreak associated with sprouts in Germany, 2011. Sprouting provides suitable conditions for bacterial growth and may lead to transduction of non-pathogenic strains of E. coli with Stx phages. Although transduction of E. coli by Stx phages in food has been documented, data on the phages from E. coli O104:H4 is limited. This study determined the host range of the bacteriophage Phi11-3088 from E. coli O104:H4 using E. coli O104:H4 Deltastx2::gfp::ampr and demonstrated phage transduction during sprouting. The Phi11-3088Deltastx transduced 5/45 strains, including generic E. coli, pap-positive E. coli O103:H2, ETEC, and S. sonnei. The expression level of Phi11-3088Deltastx differed among lysogens upon induction. Of the 3 highly induced lysogens, the lytic cycle was induced in E. coli O104:H4Deltastx2::gfp::ampr and O103:H2 but not in S. sonnei. E. coli DH5alpha was the only strain susceptible to lytic infection by Phi11-3088Deltastx. To explore the effect of drying and rehydration during seed storage and sprouting on phage induction and transduction, mung beans inoculated with the phage donor E. coli O104:H4Deltastx2::gfp::ampr (8 log CFU/g) were dried, rehydrated, and incubated with the phage recipient E. coli DH5alpha (7 log CFU/g) for 96 h. Sprouted seeds harbored about 3 log CFU/g of putative lysogens that acquired ampicillin resistance. At the end of sprouting, 71 % of putative lysogens encoded gfp, confirming phage transduction. Overall, stx transfer by phages may increase the cell counts of STEC during sprouting by converting generic E. coli to STEC. All rights reserved, Elsevier Chlorine and peroxyacetic acid (PAA) are commonly applied in dump tanks and flume systems in commercial fresh apple packing lines; however, little is known about their practical efficacies in dump tank water systems. This study evaluated the efficacies of chlorine and PAA to control Listeria monocytogenes on fresh apples and cross-contamination in simulated dump tank water (SDTW). Efficacies of chlorinated water with initial free chlorine (FC) of 25-100 ppm against L. monocytogenes on apples were significantly impacted by the presence of organic matter, especially for chlorine with 25 ppm initial FC. Chlorine with initial FCs of 50-100 ppm and 2 min contact reduced L. monocytogenes on apples by ~0.9 log10 CFU/apple in SDTW with 1000 ppm chemical oxygen demand (COD). However, 2-5 min wash of chlorine with 25 ppm initial FC only led to ~0.3 log10 CFU/apple reduction of L. monocytogenes on apples in SDTW compared to ~0.9 log10 CFU/apple reduction in clean water. The impacts of organic matter on the antimicrobial efficacy of PAA are concentration dependent. At 20-80 ppm and tested contact times (2-5min), efficacies of PAA against L. monocytogenes were not influenced by organic matter presented in SDTW; 2-5min wash with PAA 80 ppm caused 1.7-1.8 log10 CFU/apple log reduction. However, the anti-Listeria efficacy of 10 ppm PAA was significantly lower in SDTW than in clean water. Sanitizers at the tested concentrations reduced L. monocytogenes transferred from contaminated apples to uncontaminated apples and SDTW but did not eliminate it. There were 1.7-0.6 and 1.0-0.9 log10 CFU/apple of L. monocytogenes transferred to uninoculated apples in SDTW treated with 50-100 ppm FC and 60-80 ppm PAA, respectively, for 2 min, while 3.6-3.7 log10 CFU/apple of L. monocytogenes were transferred to uncontaminated apples in SDTW without any sanitizer treatments. Data indicated that sanitizer treatments in SDTW are effective but can be further improved to ensure the microbial safety of apples. All rights reserved, Elsevier Clostridium perfringens is a well-known pathogen that causes foodborne disease. With a high prevalence of contamination in food, an efficient strategy is needed to decontaminate those contaminated foods and control the emergence of foodborne disease. In this study, the C. perfringens-specific lytic phage vB_CpeP_HN02 (designated as phage HN02) was isolated from chicken feces. Electron microscopy and phylogenetic analysis suggested that phage vB_CpeP_HN02 is a novel phage of the family Podoviridae. Phage HN02 had good pH (5-11) and temperature tolerance (< 70 Â°C). Phage HN02 exhibited a broad host range of C. perfringens isolates (42.86%). The complete genome of the phage HN02 was sequenced and revealed a linear double-stranded DNA genome. The 17,754-bp genome (GenBank MW815121) with average GC content of 28.2% includes 22 predicted open reading frames, of which only 10 were annotated with known functions. Phylogenetic analysis of the available C. perfringens phage major capsid protein demonstrated that phage HN02 is closely related to virulent C. perfringens phage phi24R and CPD2. When phage HN02 was applied to chicken meat samples stored at 4 Â°C for 72 h with 1*106 to 1*109 PFU/g, 95% to 99% of C. perfringens were inactivated on chicken meat surfaces after storage at 4 Â°C for 72 h, respectively. It should be noted that C. perfringens could be completely lysed by a high dose of phage HN02 (1*1010 PFU/g) after 48 h treatment in chicken samples. Through the lytic activity testing, phage HN02 showed good antimicrobial effects, and can be used as an antibacterial agent for biocontrol of C. perfringens in meat products.

       " \"Emulsion-based delivery systems have been reported to improve the solubility, stability and bioavailability of astaxanthin. In this study, the ability of astaxanthin-loaded emulsions (AL) to ameliorate obesity induced by a high-fat and high-sucrose diet was explored, using astaxanthin in the oil phase (ASTA) as a comparison. After the administration of AL, ASTA (30 mg per kg body weight), or saline on normal or obese mice for 4 weeks, the body fat accumulation levels, hepatic lipid contents and hepatic fatty acid profiles were detected, and AL showed better anti-obesity properties than ASTA. In an acute feeding experiment, it was first observed that the astaxanthin concentration of AL was higher than that of ASTA in the blood and liver of obese mice. What's more, AL altered the microbial co-occurrence patterns in obese mice. Some gut microbial modules that were significantly correlated with obesity-related physiological parameters were identified. Overall, the improvement effect of AL on obesity is better than that of ASTA due to their higher oral absorbability and modulating effects on the gut microbiota, and we suggest AL as a more suitable astaxanthin product type for obese bodies. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 The work aimed to prepare pea protein isolate-chitosan (PPI-CS) nanoparticles, fabricate PPI-CS nanoparticles stabilized Pickering emulsions (PPI-CS Pickering emulsions) and deliver EPA for digestion in vitro and in vivo. The nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and PPI-CS Pickering emulsions were characterized by physicochemical and rheological properties. The results showed that the size of PPI-CS nanoparticles was 194.220.45 nm. Rheological measurement showed that the PPI-CS Pickering emulsions possessed a gel-like network. EPA encapsulated Pickering emulsions (EPA-PE, phi=0.6) exhibited a high retention rate (93%) during storage and performed a lower release rate compared with EPA-PE (phi=0.4) in vitro digestion. The area under the curve of EPA concentration of EPA-PE group and EPA-emulsions (EPA-Em) group was 1.71 and 1.48, respectively. It demonstrated that PPI-CS Pickering emulsions provided the possibility to deliver EPA for digestive absorption. All rights reserved, Elsevier Background. Astaxanthin (ASTA) is a kind of food-derived active ingredient (FDAI) with antioxidant and antidiabetic functions. It is nontoxic but its poor solubility and low bioavailability hinder its application in the food industry. In this study, a novel carrier, polyethylene glycol-grafted chitosan (PEG-g-CS) was applied to enhance the bioavailability of astaxanthin. It encapsulated astaxanthin completely by solvent evaporation to manufacture astaxanthin using poly (ethylene glycol)-graft-chitosan nanoparticles (ASTA-PEG-g-CS) nanoparticles to improve absorption. Results. The ASTA-PEG-g-CS nanoparticles were spherical, with a particle size below 200nm and a zeta potential of about-26mV. Polyethylene glycol-grafted chitosan can encapsulate astaxanthin well, and the encapsulated astaxanthin was released rapidly-in 15min in an in vitro release study. In a rat single-pass intestinal perfusion study, a low concentration of ASTA-PEG-g-CS nanoparticle (0.2 mugmL-1) was better absorbed in the intestine. In particular, the jejunum could absorb most astaxanthin without a change in the concentration. An in vivo release study also demonstrated that ASTA-PEG-g-CS nanoparticles enhanced oral bioavailability significantly. Conclusion. This novel carrier, PEG-g-CS, provided a simple way to encapsulate food, which improved the bioavailability of hydrophobic ingredients. Â© 2021 Society of Chemical Industry\",\n",
       " 'The aim of this study was to investigate the hypoglycemic activity of phenols extracted from Pleioblastus amarus (Keng) shells (PASs), and to isolate and identify the possible components of which o-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, quercetin-3-0-rhamnoside, and apigenin-7-0-glucoside exhibited a strong affinity with alpha-glucosidase and were identified as potential The results revealed that, Pleioblastus amarus (Keng) shell phenols (PASP) displayed hypoglycemic activity in vitro, inhibiting alpha-glucosidase (IC50 = 0.158 0.002mg/mL) while improving glucose consumption in insulin-resistant (IR) HepG2 cells, as well as the intracellular glycogen content and hexokinase (HK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. Twelve phenolic compounds were detected by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs). This study suggests that PASs, as a by-product, has the potential to become a new raw material source for hypoglycemic functional food, providing an application prospect for commonly considered waste product. All rights reserved, Elsevier Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum, TB) is rich in flavonoid glycosides, which are transformed into aglycones and ethyl-beta-rutinoside by endogenous rutin-degrading enzymes. However, the enzymatic reaction efficacy has only been assessed in TB seeds, whilst comprehensive information regarding the catalytic capabilities of other edible tissues is limited. Herein, based on an improved UPLC-MS/MS method, aglycones and ethyl-rutinoside, which are generated from enzyme-induced transglycosylation and hydrolysis reactions, were investigated under different enzymatic treatment parameters in a model reaction system. Subsequently, with previously optimized enzymatic parameters (temperature, 40 Â°C; ethanol concentration, 20%; reaction time, 30 min), the enzymatic catalysis potency was evaluated in different tissues of TB. After enzymatic treatment, the highest yields of ethyl-rutinoside (20.59 mg/g) and aglycones (10.84 mg/g) were observed in the bran of TB. Moreover, the powder of different TB tissues was utilized to produce bread, and bread with TB bran also exhibited the highest levels of aglycones (3.41 mg/g) and ethyl-rutinoside (1.75 mg/g). These results provide good evidence for the optimal utilization of TB bran for the enrichment of foods with ethyl-rutinoside and aglycones for potential health benefits. All rights reserved, Elsevier Tartary buckwheat (TB) bran contains endogenous rutin-degrading enzyme (RDE), which can convert flavonoid glycosides into aglycones and ethyl-rutinoside with potential health benefits. However, the large particle size of TB bran limits its application in food industry. The present study aims to combine micronization and endogenous RDE catalysis for the treatment of TB bran. Here, four TB bran samples, with distinct D50 values (the equivalent volume diameters at 50% cumulative volume) of 359, 239, 168 and 42mum, were prepared by superfine grinding; their physical properties were evaluated. Additionally, with RDE catalysis, the phytochemical compounds, antioxidant and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of the four bran samples were investigated. Compared to the unprocessed material, TB bran (D50, 42mum) exhibited the highest amount of aglycones and ethyl-rutinoside after RDE catalysis, with the total content increased from 1mg/g to 35mg/g. Importantly, after superfine grinding and RDE catalysis, the antioxidant and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of TB bran significantly increased. Theoretically, molecular docking verified that the increased aglycone (quercetin), generated after RDE catalysis, is the predominant alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. Accordingly, the combination of superfine grinding and RDE catalysis is a feasible technology for developing high value-added TB bran products. All rights reserved, Elsevier']"
